        <p><font size="4"><b>Attempt was made by taking sensitive 
        readings of electromagnetic fields over time in the plasma 
        table at the Physics department here at OSU. The results are 
        grayscale; the image you see as 'attemp03' is a composite of 
        many of these with coloring added. Each layer has only one 
        color, but I used similar colors for scans taken one right 
        after another. The electromagnetic fields in the plasma 
        table array are quasi-linear submanifolds, and change very 
        rapidly. I wrote a program to watch the fields and grab 
        snapshots when something 'interesting' showed 
        up. For the majority of the time the E.M.F. array is dull and 
        boring. The array is excited, causing the cool patterns, by
        injecting RMG particles (which are electrons, but with their 
        spins reduced or enhanced). When I started using these to
        create a piece of art I had over 10,000 images to work with!
        Needless to say, most of them were not interesting, or only
        interesting in isolation. Attempt03 is a combination of around 
        200 of these, and took me something like 80 hours to composite 
        (over the period of a month or so). </b></font></p>

        spins... if you didn't think it was funny, you're not geek
