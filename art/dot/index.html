          <font face="Arial,Helvetica">Inspired by looking over graduate school 
          publications, this is a very interesting result of moire pattern and JPEG image 
          compression artifacts. The first being rather subtle, and the second being 
          rather dominant. Also inherent is my fascination with the discreteness of the 
          pixel, which is why the image is rather blocky and jagged. Also apparent is the 
          recursive, or fractal, nature of the patterns, love of simple form, and 
          communication between to sides. Finally, on a more subtle note, is the issue 
          of emergence, modification via passing through a system, and contrast of input 
          vs output.</font>

          <font face="Arial,Helvetica">Just above you can see the stages this image went through. 
          The first four set up the initial dot image. This image is a 
          clean image, and you can see this mid point below. The next 
          step shows a close up of the jpeg compression and the 
          sharpening filters. The image has been compressed and then 
          enlarged, and the artifacts exaggerated. The second last 
          frame shows the overall image at this point. The last step 
          is to add a bit more color. A moire pattern is created, as 
          seen enlarged in the last frame, and combined to the full 
          image.</font>
