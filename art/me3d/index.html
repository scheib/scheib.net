        <p align="center">At Siggraph`98 (A conference on
        computer graphics) a vendor sat me down, snapped a
        picture, and handed me a floppy disk with my bust as a 3D
        model. =) How cool. The picture above is just a collage
        of still shots of that 3D model. </p>
        <p align="center">You can <a href="me3d.wrl"><strong>view
        the 3d model in your browser</strong></a>. However, it uses an old 3D 
        format called VRML, that isn't well supported these days. Oh well.</p>
        <p align="center">If you are one of those lucky people
        who can see stereograms take a look at this picture:<br>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="600"

    <tr>
        <td><p align="center">To see it you should relax your
        eyes, looking beyond the monitor. The two white dots at
        the top of the picture will split into four. The middle
        two of these white dots will drift towards each other as
        you relax your eyes and look farther through the monitor.
        Try to look at these middle two dots, and they will come
        together and make just one dot. When that has happened
        you've made the picture come into '3D focus' and can
        slowly look down at it to see me in 3D (I have a big
        nose, it should stick out at you.).<br>
