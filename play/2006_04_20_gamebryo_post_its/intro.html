One night I placed post-it notes around the office kitchen. When viewed from a particular location, you can see that they form a pattern (the Gamebryo logo). That logo is a trade mark of the <a target="_top" href="http://www.gamebryo.com/">Gamebryo</a> game engine.

<br>
Many people have done similar things before me.
<br>
<br>
For example, the artist <a target="_top" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felice_Varini">Felice Varini</a> has been doing art based on 2D image projection into the world for decades.
