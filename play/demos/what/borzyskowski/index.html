<P>ABSTRACT</P>



<P></P>



<P>The paper reports on a study undertaken into vernacular forms of multimedia

production referred to as &quot;demos&quot; or &quot;intros&quot; and variants

of these terms among adherents of a computer oriented subculture identifying

itself as &quot;the scene&quot;. The cultural and technological factors

which are thought to have influenced the evolution of the genre since the

early 1980's are discussed as are observations which distinguish a specific,

almost exclusively male gender, internationally dispersed anarchistic youth

subculture which holds this form of cultural production as a principal
objective.

An analysis of a number of examples of the genre provides tentative information

on the dynamics of the subculture which survives on the basis of liberty

and co-operation in the absence of coercive or cohesive structural influence,

and presents an overview of the "demo" genre form in terms of function and
audio
 visual syntax. </P>


<P></P>



<P>INTRODUCTION</P>
The study was undertaken from 1992 to 1994 and resulted in an account

of a cyberculture which evolved before the current widespread availabilityof

access to the world wide web via graphical browsers such as Mosaic, Netscape

or Internet Explorer. It was and is a subculture whose transactions are

created and delivered through the computer screen, though in it's formative

years the transmission and exchange of the data was by means of floppy disk

passed on by hand or through the international postal service. Files were

also maintained and distributed on private <I>scene</I> bulletin board systems.

These were operated by keen amateurs while the internet was still the exclusive

domain of government instrumentalities and research institutions. It is

also a subculture about which very little has been written or reported outside

of its own internal communications in the form of diskzines, and <I>demo

scrolltexts</I> and the author acknowledges the useful information in the

book by Phil Shatz <I>Walkthoughs and Flybys </I>and the more recent article

<I>Digital Graffiti</I> which appeared in the UK edition of WIRED magazine,

issue 1.03 in June 1995, by Dave Green, and republished in the US edition,

issue 3.07 in July 1995, retitled <I>Demo Or Die!</I> (the unacknowledged

slogan of demo group SANITY). The resources accessed at the time of the

<P>As a result of the meteoric popularisation of internet, dramatic
improvements

in lodgement and access to online information which have occurred in the short

time since the completion of this authors preliminary study and in addition

to the publication of several CD ROM compilations of demos now available,

today information on the subject under discussion is readily available by

simply entering the word <I>demo</I> into the requestor of a favourite search

engine. Useful suggested starting points are:</P>



<P></P>

<P></P>



<P>In this paper the <I>demo</I> and <I>intro</I> genre of computer based

audio visual production, is shown to be the primary sign equipment of groups

within a subculture usually referred to from within, as <I>the scene</I>,

the <I>demo scene</I> or the <I>Amiga scene</I>. The scene is an aspect

of a wider information technology related cultural environment which has

it's origins with the beginnings of the automation of national and
international

telecommunications, and is characterised by an impetus among its adherents

towards the discovery and exploitation of features available within the

technological environment which are not publicly documented. The hacker

ethos within Today's information culture has been journalistically incorporated

within a once fashionable, now passe <I>cyberpunk</I> image, which while
sharing some philosophical

positions and possibly providing attributes in terms of personal accessories

which might be adopted by individuals, is not however representative of

the <I>demo scene</I>. It is shown that in terms of traditional sociological

criteria, the <I>demo scene</I> can be regarded as a distinct subculture

in it's own right, and that the body of audio visual production is substantial

and constant enough in purpose to warrant recognition as a distinct category

of cultural artefact. The complexity of this cultural production however,

and the incremental development of sophistication raises questions of
motivation

beyond it's immediate functionality.</P>



<P></P>



<P>REASONS FOR THE INVESTIGATION</P>



<P></P>



<P>The investigation into this vernacular form of multimedia was undertaken

in order to gain knowledge about the extent of this form of cultural
production,

some understanding as to the motivation involved, and to explore the
possibility

of applying elements of the audio visual syntax observed in the production

of audio visual communication directed at a youth audience. </P>



<P></P>



<P>The investigation was undertaken following the casual observation and

collection of these materials since 1986 following the acquisition of an

Amiga computer system. When this study commenced in 1992, some 70 examples

of the genre had been collected on 3.5 inch micro floppy disks, their normal

means of distribution. Although the extent of this form of production was

not known at the time, a number of the examples contained sufficient material

of a technical and audio visual sophistication not possible to easily replicate

using the conventional audio visual and multimedia software of the day,

coupled with apparently international origins and the use of obscure pseudonyms

or <I>tags</I> by the authors, to indicate that further investigation of

the phenomenon might be worth while. During the following period until March

1993, a total of 765 examples of the genre were collected and database
catalogued

according to the criteria listed below. Analysis of the collected data revealed

391 different groups as being responsible for this production. Speton's

data revealed a further 320 groups (Speton J G,<I>
aminet/text/hyper/adl1129.lha</I>,

Aminet Amiga CD ROM, Walnut Creek, USA, Feb. 1994). Though not definitive,

711 groups internationally, involved in cultural production of a particular

audio visual genre is thought to be significant..</P>



<P></P>



<P>Other factors prompting the investigation were the apparent absence of

this sometimes irreverent though frequently spectacular genre of production

associated with the two market dominant personal computer types of the day,

the Apple Macintosh and the IBM PC or its clones, and paucity of any discussion

of the genre in either culturally or computer oriented literature with the

exception of passing acknowledgment of specific examples and their special

effects but exclusively within the Amiga computer oriented leisure press.

</P>



<P></P>



<P>OBSERVED EXAMPLES</P>



<P></P>



<P>Of the materials at hand at the commencement of the study which could

be attributed to the demo or intro genre, a number of characteristics were

evident which distinguished this type of production from the several thousand

commercial and non commercial software titles available. These can be
enumerated

thus: </P>



<P>a. The programs are not commercially produced for sale.</P>



<P>b. The authors and contributors if identified almost always use
pseudonyms.</P>



<P>c. The items generally allude to a syndicated allegiance with a group

name.</P>



<P>d. The programs' overt function is message passing and skill exposition.</P>



<P>e. Kinetic qualities were unachievable using commercial multimedia
software.</P>



<P>f. Real time computer generated music is part of the presentation.</P>



<P>g. Visual effects push the supposed limits of the machine's capability.</P>



<P>h. Chronologically developing repertoire of visual kinetic effects.</P>



<P>i. If included, frequently uninhibited, egotistical, vernacular text.</P>



<P>k. Visual presentation generally non narrative, often linked to or by

music.</P>



<P>l. Evidently almost entirely male gender produced. </P>



<P>m. The software code is inaccessible without highly specialised
knowledge.</P>



<P>n. The software frequently employs a non standard disk operating system.</P>



<P>o. Graphic design content is often skilfully executed.</P>



<P>p. Graphic style frequently derived from science fiction or fantasy
genre.</P>



<P>q. Visual effects often copied from other demos with increased
sophistication.</P>



<P>r. International origins attributable, predominantly to northern Europe.</P>



<P>s. Evidence of cross national co-operation in production.</P>



<P>t. Evidence of predominantly adolescent male youth participation.</P>



<P>u. Distribution by mail, modem, PD software libraries and personal
contact</P>



<P>v. . Minor acknowledgment, only in Amiga computer specific leisure press.

</P>



<P></P>



<P></P>



<P>AVAILABLE LITERATURE</P>



<P></P>



<P>A literature search conducted at the time with the aim of determining

both the extent and motivation behind the production of the materials under

investigation revealed no direct or significant critical commentary on the

artifacts here referred to as Demos or Intros published prior to 1993. There

were however numerous references to the materials in a variety of Amiga

computer specific, mainly leisure oriented magazines. These references usually

within columns discussing PD or public domain software are limited to
announcements

of new examples with brief descriptions and subjective assessments by the

editorial staff. This approach to the subject has been common in a number

of British magazines for some years. A regular item for example in the British

publication <I>Amiga Format</I> since 1990, has been <I>Demos Corner</I>,

currently <I>PD Demo Zone</I>. Typical of the style of critique offered

follows:</P>



<P></P>



<P>INTROS DISK #23 17 Bit Disk 550</P>



<P>Six superb mini demos from the likes of D-Mob, Level 4, Red and Black,

Powerlords, Jester Brothers and Unique. Just when you thought you were safe

from any further Batman hype, the Jester Brothers spring on you the remix

of the Batdance Remix. Meaner, moodier and more manic than before.</P>



<P>You'll love it to bits.</P>



<P>(Amiga Format, March 1990, p. 93)</P>



<P></P>



<P>Subsequently such sections in magazines have frequently been accompanied

by <I>Top Ten</I> charts provided by public domain software distribution

companies supplying the review software, although the titles listed usually

include many items of a more general nature such as slide shows, music disks

and utilities not falling within the remit of the characteristics enumerated

above. This is a typical listing provided by <I>Telescan Computer
Services</I>:</P>



<P></P>



<P>1. Fit Chix II AGA



<P>2. Bodyshop </P>



 <P>3. Point of Sale AGA </P>



 <P>4. Heliopolis  AGA</P>



 <P>5. World of Manga AGA </P>


 <P>6. Clairvoyance</P>


 <P>7. Boris Vallejo</P>

 <P>8. Vomit</P>

 <P>9. Dreamtripping </P>

 <P>10. Technological Death</P>

<P>[<I>AGA denotes advanced graphics architecture, a colour display mode</I>.]

(Bradley S, PD Demo Zone, Amiga Format, January 1994)</P>



<P></P>



<P>It must be said that little information is to be gained from such reviews

and while acclamation is in evidence for the effects achieved, insight into

the motivation behind the productions is extremely scarce, if not none
existent.

As essentially marketing vehicles for commercial software and hardware vendors,

a general observation concerning the leisure press available for overview

without detailed scrutiny, indicates this source not to be particularly

fruitful as a focus of insight into the material under investigation.</P>



<P></P>



<P>WALKTHROUGHS AND FLYBYS</P>



<P></P>



<P>In his book (Shatz P, <I>Wakthroughs And Flybys</I> CD, Waite Group Press,

1993), Shatz usefully touches on the nature of demos and provides some insight

into the reason for their production. The &quot;flashy bits&quot; he writes,

are written in custom assembly language and that the creators have &quot;broken

every rule and used every trick necessary to squeeze the maximum performance

out of your PC&quot;. This confirms the view arrived at in this study since

the history of the genre appears to be strongly characterised by an irreverence

for the official performance specification of the hardware used. Three further

characteristics drawn from Shatz's small sample are significant and in line

with the observations of the present study. The age distribution of the

producers, the teamwork involved and the issue of attitude. The ages of

members of the <I>Future Crew</I> are reported as ranging from 16 to 21.

They &quot;intend to keep creating demos and distributing them for free

because they have so much fun doing so&quot;. Shatz states that the groups,

referring to the message networks of Europe, &quot;exude a spirit of
co-operation

that is quite difficult for the average secretive Silicon Valley software

developer to understand&quot; and that for &quot;these kids&quot; it's all

&quot;just a hobby&quot;. Finally Shatz usefully describes the division

of labour, due to the complexity of the process required to complete a
<I>demo</I>

project which can take up to a year to produce, the division of labour being

amongst graphics specialists , music specialists and programmers.</P>



<P></P>



<P>IDENTIFICATION AND SOURCING OF THE STUDY MATERIAL</P>



<P></P>



<P>An understanding and definition of the descriptors &quot;demo&quot;,

variant &quot;megademo&quot; and &quot;intro&quot; as well as well as the

comprehensive descriptors for the source, the &quot;demo scene&quot; or

just the &quot;scene&quot;, relevant to this study based upon common usage

in the relevant leisure press, common self reference within the texts
incorporated

in the study materials themselves, and confirmation within electronic
publications,

<I>DISKZINES</I> or disk magazines distributed within what revealed itself

to be the international community of demo producers, and occurring in
commercial

PD libraries, ftp sites and on Bulettin Board systems. Some 400 disks were

collected for the study yielding 743 examples of the genre and more than

20 titles of underground diskzines including:<I> FREEDOM CRACK, EUROCHART,

INFANT DISK MAG, FRAUD, GRAPEVINE, RAM JAM, ZINE, ICE, HACK MAG, MCDISK,

STOLEN DATA, TRADER, TOP SECRET, SLIME, FREE 'N' EASY, CRACKERS JOURNAL,

CHIT CHAT, MAGGY, PLAYBYTE and BLIPVERTS</I>. Other materials were music

disks, animation disks and a variety of miscellaneous utility software and

picture disks generally emanating from the demo community, used for reference

but not strictly part of this study. The diskzines are the exception since

in addition to texts embedded in the demos and intros themselves, they
constitute

the prime source for a view of the fabric of a subculture.</P>



<P></P>



<P>STUDY SAMPLE ANALYSIS</P>



<P></P>



<P>The collected genre examples were videorecorded and a database was
constructed

in order to extract information useful to the study objective pertaining

to the extent of this form of cultural production as well as facilitating

access to specific examples within the collection for further study. A number

of database searches revealsed the following:</P>



<P></P>



<P>391 differently named groups were identified as having produced the
collected

743 examples of the genre between 1987 and 1993.</P>



<P></P>



<P>Of the genre sample collected, 1 item was produced in 1987, 14 items

in 1988, 85 items in 1989, 246 items in 1990, 271 items in 1991, 125 items

in 1992 and 1 item in 1993. </P>



<P></P>



<P>Of the 391 groups identified in the sample, 265 produced only 1 demo

each, 64 groups produced 2 each, 26 produced 3 each, 13 produced 4, 6 produced

5, 4 produced 6 each, 5 produced 7 each, 1 group produced 9, 3 groups produced

10 each, 3 groups produced 11 each and one group <I>Anarchy</I> of the UK,

had produced 20 demos or intros in addition to 10 issues of <I>Stolen Data</I>

disk magazine by the time of the survey.</P>



<P></P>



<P>Out of the 743 collected, 339 genre examples were identified where a

country of origin was readily evident either by direct statement of contact

address or given international telephone number. Of these 64 were produced

in the now United Germany, 47 in Finland, 45 in Australia, 38 in Sweden,

38 in Norway, 30 in Denmark, 26 in the UK, 21 in France, 10 in Switzerland,

8 in the USA, 8 in The Netherlands, 8 in Austria, 6 in Holland, 5 in New

Zealand, 5 in Italy, 5 in Belgium, 4 in Poland, 4 multinational, 3 in Turkey,

3 in Hungary, 1 in Iceland, 1 in Luxembourg and 1 in the former Yugoslavia.

(NB. Many of the examples of the genre, indicated within scrolling texts

and greeting lists that groups had members and chapters active in more than

one country and review of the material suggests that international cooperation

on projects is substantially more prevalent than the 4 identified examples

suggest). </P>



<P></P>



<P>DYNAMICS OF THE SUBCULTURE</P>



<P></P>



<P>The database analysis suggests that demo groups are in the main ephemeral

entities, two thirds of the sample producing only one example of the demo

or intro genre. Taking into account Speton's data, the indication is that

probably closer to three quarters of identified groups have created no more

than one production. Further conclusions which may be drawn from the data

and scene disk publications are that groups, which are often very small,

consisting of as few as two individuals consist essentially of fairly transient

alliances; that members are not necessarily limited in their allegiance

exclusively to one group, it not being uncommon for individuals from one

group contributing to the productions of another or simply changing groups

(this is confirmed in scene disk publication articles such as the news section

of <I>Grapevine #12</I>,  and that individual active membership

of the scene is in the majoroty of cases relatively short term, one or two

years. </P>



<P></P>



<P>Of the 391 groups identified from the 743 genre examples collected in

this study only 24 have productions whose dates of origin have been identified

as spanning more than 2 years. Of the 24, 3 groups, Alcatraz, Fairlight

and Kefrens have been identified as having productions spanning the 5 years

from 1988 to 1992. The productions of 9 groups, Crionics, Defjam, Razor

1911, Rebels, Red Sector, Scoopex, Silents, Spreadpoint and Zenith span

4 years; and from 12 groups Anarchy, Complex, Decay, Dual Crew, Majic 12,

Mystix, Paralax, Sanity, Share And Enjoy, Slipstream, Zaphod (an individual)

and Zero Defects span 3years.</P>



<P></P>



<P>SOFTWARE PIRACY</P>



<P></P>



<P>Media reporting, anecdote and hearsay suggest, that among others, elements

within the demo scene have been associated with software piracy, as referred

to above, that is the duplication and/or distribution of commercially produced

software in contravention of copyright legislation and other aspects of

the criminal code in various countries. This has been borne out in examination

of the text legends in the category of productions known as intros. Intros

to what? A question with a frequently obvious answer confirmed in an article

<I>Hoist the Jolly Roger</I> by Kelly Beswick (Amiga Games, October 1991,

p46-48) with the explanation:</P>



<P></P>



<P>&quot;When you first load a copy of a game that's been pirated by a

team of crackers, you usually see a list of names running across the bottom

of the screen. These are the pseudonyms the hackers like to give themselves.

It's all part of the bravado, with messages being sent to fellow pirates

and sly digs being made at the people who provide the technical
protection.&quot;</P>



<P></P>



<P>Anecdotal and journalistic evidence suggests that computer software piracy

as a social phenomenon generally pervades the growing international community

of computer users, though numerically probably to a lesser extent than
broadcast

media and music piracy in the context of domestic off air video and audio

copying and re-recording. It seems nevertheless that official and commercial

interests need a focus for blame. Hackers as a generic entity emerge as

prime candidates, an ill defined subgroup of society more sharply and
fashionably

called cyberpunks following William Gibsons imaginative nomenclature
&quot;cyberspace&quot;

in his book <I>Neuromancer</I> (Victor Gollancz publ. 1984) and Marianne

Trench's 1990 documentary film <I>Cyberpunk</I> . </P>



<P></P>



<P>Certainly in the Amiga world this association is clear and seemingly

blatantly confirmed. Many supposed teenage exponents of copy protection

code breaking, <I>crackers</I>, purposely attract attention to themselves

or at least their adopted and ominous pseudonym entities through the inclusion

of cynical announcements in their distributed illicit entertainment products.

Cooperative endeavour in obtaining, cracking and redistributing illicit

software appears to be one of the focus activities of demo groups. </P>



<P></P>



<P>Breaking copy protection schemes while in itself a challenge is inevitably

also a form of industrial sabotage and it is clear that there are determined

elements within the international hacker and demo subculture whose anti

corporate disposition gains an aberrant satisfaction from the causation

of overt destruction of commercial protection. The issue of this form of

impersonal violence against organisations through their commercial property

is perhaps usefully enlightened by Laurie Taylor and Paul Walton's essay

<I>Idustrial Sabotage: Motives and meanings</I> (Ed. Cohen S, Images of

Deviance, Pelican 1971, p.219-245). Walton and Taylor examine both sabotage

as fun and as individualistic destruction. They describe industrial situations

&quot;where there appears to be almost a hysterical atmosphere in which

every opportunity for `cocking' up the works will be taken&quot;. They conclude

&quot;collective messing up of the commodity is another occasion for a gleeful

release of tension&quot;. </P>

<P>THE HACKER SUBCULTURE</P>



<P></P>



<P>In terms of this study an appropriate general definition of hacker is

to be found in The New Hacker's Dictionary (Raymond E, MIT Press, 1992 3rd

ed):</P>



<P></P>



<P>&quot;hacker [originally one who makes furniture with an axe] n.1. A

person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how

to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn

only the minimum necessary.... 7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge

of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations. 8. [depreciated]

A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking

around. Hence password hacker, network hacker. See cracker....&quot;</P>



<P></P>



<P>&quot;cracker n. One who breaks security on a system. Coined ca. 1985

by hackers in defence against journalistic misuse of hacker....&quot;</P>



<P></P>



<P>An interesting application of the relevant term appears in the title

of Michael Scott's <I>article Hacking the Material World</I> (Wired,
July/August

1993, p. 60-61), referring to &quot;true hacker's spirit&quot; he states

&quot;Tunnellers are hacking the subterranean passages and hidden crawl

spaces of colleges and universities across America....&quot;. Scott describes

a style of architectural adventuring engaged in by groups of students at

campuses across the USA, in which the objective is to penetrate and discover

hidden accesses, service corridors and shafts of large buildings, presumably

for the thrill and adventure of it, and answering the challenge of discovering

the unknown. </P>



<P></P>



<P>In the foreword to Eric Raymond's dictionary is an account by Guy Steele

Jr. of a hacker community pre-dating the present where the preoccupation

was the invention and development of a technology and the establishing of

early computer networking systems rather than the sinister activities ascribed

generally to hackers and cyberpunks today. </P>



<P></P>



<P>CYBERPUNK AND THE DEMO SCENE</P>



<P></P>



<P>Within the demo scene the audio visual cultural artifact produced has

become a currency. It is a means of transaction not only for the expression

of a set of aesthetic ideals but also for the claiming of status and respect

within a transnational community. These productions seem to be a means for

declaring mastery over an aspect of an increasingly technologically mediated

world. This ability to manipulate technology as evident in the demos and

intros produced and the rapidity with which software copy protection schemes

are cracked sits comfortably alongside a cyberpunk creed which declares

oneness with technology. This assertion of continued presence by Kaauld

appeared in issue 16 of the demo group LSD's, Grapevine underground diskzine

circulated in December 1993:</P>

<P>So, was cyberpunk a mid/late '80's idea that never made it off the street?

Or is it still around, festering like the cancerous growth it was always

meant to be? Well, I'm a cyberpunk and I don't care. If it runs on any form

of electricity I want it! I'll fix it! I'll fuck it! I'll live it! So, are

you a cyberpunk? Here's some of the essential things for a 'punk to have:

was NOT a mid '80's idea. It's been around for years. It just got popular

in the mid '80's. </P>



<P></P>



<P>I'm 22 now and I've been a 'punk since 83 and I like it. If anyone wants

<P>A further contribution in the same issue is worth examining in this context

of a style of existence. Where Kauuld list attributes and accessories, the

anonymous author, Cygnus, here elaborates a philosophical position, perhaps

idealised but certainly expressing an elitist stance at odds with and distinct

from the mainstream of society. A strategy for survival? </P>

<P>I N D I V I D U A L I S M </P>



<P>Cyberpunk is the triumph of the individual through the power of technology.

Modern and post-modern technology has given the individual the power to

express and realize the creative diversity of his own ideas, a power
unprecedented

in history.</P>



<P></P>



<P>P E R S O N A L T E C H N O L O G Y </P>



<P>Cyberpunk is closely linked with personal technology, which can be defined

as technology which is &quot;close to the skin.&quot; Examples are the personal

computer, the Walkman, the colour-changing contact lens, and so on. This

is the kind of technology which gives power to the individual. </P>



<P></P>



<P>T H E E D G E </P>



<P>Cyberpunk is existence on the Edge. The Edge refers to the frontiers,

be they social, technological, or mental. It is an attitude which embraces

the new, is willing to try the untried, is willing to experiment. It is

a fascination with the fringes, and the boundary conditions, and in general,

with the Edge of current reality. </P>



<P></P>



<P>S T Y L E </P>



<P>Cyberpunk is Style. Style is used to make a point, to entertain, and

to make an individual stand out in a crowd. In Cyberpunk, Style applies

to everything from fashion, to software, to hardware, to behaviour, to
everything

under the Sun. Whatever it is, it should look good, feel slick, and be done

with elegance. In Cyberpunk, Style is the ultimate weapon, and it is used

to wage war on the mundane. </P>



<P></P>



<P>I N N O V A T I O N </P>



<P>Cyberpunk is innovation at all levels. It is the attitude that there

is always a better way of doing something and that there is glory in
discovering

it. </P>



<P></P>



<P>D I A G O N A L T H I N K I N G </P>



<P>Cyberpunk is diagonal thinking, which can be defined as creative rule

breaking, nonconformal cerebration and, in general, using virgin neural

pathways on a regular basis. It is very closely linked with innovation,

since innovation is frequently theresult of diagonal thinking. </P>



<P></P>



<P>U N D E R G R O U N D H U M O U R </P>



<P>There is a strong element of underground humour in Cyberpunk, and this

is a part of Style. The essential absurdity of modern life is well realized

in the concept of Cyberpunk and is expressed all over the place. It's an

irreverent attitude towards the world that characterizes Cyberpunk. </P>



<P></P>



<P>C O M M U N I C A T I O N </P>



<P>Cyberpunk is, above all, communication. The transfer and manipulation

of information (which is what communication is, in this context) is, more

than anything else, what Cyberpunk is all about. Cyberpunk rides the seas

of information along the links, whether they are video, or telephone, or

computer networks, or printed media, and it is the interaction of myriads

of individuals along those links which makes cyberpunk possible. Cyberpunk

is about the mastery of information flow and about the skill in shaping,

processing, and manipulating data.&quot; </P>



<P>(LSD [Leeds Spreading Division], Grapevine, December 1993)</P>



<P></P>



<P>Cyberpunk is primarily an intellectual attitude about personal survival,

empowerment and control within, and in defence against an all embracing

governmental and corporate technological infrastructure which seeks to dominate

society for commercial and political ends. Cyberpunk is not about a perceived

threat in demeanour in the same sense in which Hebdige discusses youth in

his book<I> Hiding In The Light</I>. The light cyberpunk hides in is not

in the visual domain on display to the public. It is impersonal, electronic,

digital, international. The kind of outward visible manifestations in person,

drawn attention to by Hebdige in the opening chapter of his book, the punk

or skinhead style might be an attribute or accessory adopted by an individual,

but it is not the central issue in cyberpunk. An element of attitude as

identified by Hebdige as &quot;The power, that is to pose - to pose a
threat.&quot;

(Hebdige D, <I>Hiding in the Light</I>, Comedia, 1988, p. 18), finds expression

on the worlds telecommunication networks and computer installations. The

riot and destruction, if it happens, is not galvanised through the dynamics

of the mob. It occurs by stealth, meted out by odd and not necessarily
aggrieved

individuals as a virus without a specific target. </P>



<P></P>



<P>Hebdige's analysis of young lives is particularly useful here and the

parallels between his observations of youth style and aspects of the demo

scene are significant. There is however a clear difference in the context

within which the external evidence of the subculture occurs. There is a

paradigm shift in the medium of the externalised expression of the culture.

Hebdige refers to visual evidence in the world accessible to conventional

perception. The demo scene operates in cyberspace. It's externalised evidence

is available only through a computer display. Hebdige's references to dress

style among youth identifying with one group or another has it's parallel

within the demo scene in the style of corporate audio visual facade the

demo groups present in their names visual symbols and logotype devices.

These present a notion of legitimacy as is the practice in conventional

business but unlike business the graphic style changes with every new demo

release only the group name remains constant, <I>Budbrain, Kefrens, Razor

1911, Italian Bad Boys, Scoopex</I> or <I>Possessed</I>. This visual corporate

facade is like the dress style of the costers which Hebdige describes or

the wearing of worthless objects as jewellery. The demo group's constant

change of visual symbol versions could be construed to be a comment in
opposition

to the permanent nature of such devices in the conventional world.</P>



<P></P>



<P>THE RELEVANCE OF CYBERPUNK TO <I>THE SCENE</I></P>



<P></P>



<P>Interestingly while cyberpunk has emerged as a journalistically convenient

term into which adherents of the demo scene might be seen most easily to

fit, it is significant that self reference either in underground publications

of the demo scene or within their productions almost never includes the

term. The two manifesto style items cited above, therefore should be viewed

as individual contributions to a scene discourse, rather than being necessarily

representative of or defining the scene in any specific way. Aspects of

cyberpunk, particularly as expressed in the Kaauld item, represent a strong

leaning or tendency towards commodity fetishism as consumer and user which

concurs with Hebdige's discussion of life in the consumption economy (<I>Hiding

In The Light</I>, p.192), the merger of subjects and objects, which is in

effect a reliance for self definition through technological possessions,

rather than the definition of self through the creation of evidence of an

ability to produce, as is the case in the demo scene. While both exist within

the technologically mediated <I>postmodern sensorium</I>, it is clear that

the <I>sign equipment</I> (Goffman E, <I>The Presentation of Self in Everyday

Life</I> (1959), Pelican 1969, p.39) employed by cyberpunk to define social

identity is appropriated in the form of technological hardware, whereas

in the demo scene it is self created in the form of audio visual cultural

artefact.</P>



<P></P>



<P>THE DEMO AS CULTURAL ARTIFACT</P>



<P></P>



<P>Demos are not made without a cost. The amount of time, patience, knowledge

and skill development required are far from trivial. To make a competent

production in this genre, graphic, musical and programming ability must

be integrated and the work can occupy from a few hours for an intro by a

veteran group, to several weeks or months for a major demo release, as is

often recollected in included texts. An interview reported in <I>RAW Diskmag

#2</I> published by PURE METAL CODERS in early 1992 between PGCS of ALCATRAZ

and Lord Helmet reports that ALCATRAZ's then new demo ODYSSEY, had taken

the group over 10 months to produce. </P>



<P></P>



<P>Invariably the production credits indicate teamwork as members contribute

different abilities towards a common end, often expressing pride in each

others work. The projects sometimes involve international cooperation as

scattered individuals or chapters collaborate on larger productions. To

the subculturally uninitiated, these productions are inconsequential, coloured

shapes flying around on screen to a musical score somewhat limited in it's

dynamic range and style. A comment that the text is meaningless and that

there are better things on the television may well be appropriate, but for

the aspiring demo maker, established group member or an amateur computer

enthusiast, a demo or intro even without text presents within the sequences

of patterns and dancing shapes, encoded information of at least equivalent

significance to the aesthetic gratification this variety of eye candy might

stimulate. </P>



<P></P>



<P>To the enlightened a secondary reading of the presentation will reveal

information about competence, skill and ingenuity in manipulating the hidden

capabilities of the hardware. This presupposes sophisticated programming

competence or at least the ability to access and modify the work of others,

preferably in assembler code. The animated images are of mathematically

described objects, geometric shapes and numerical control of the system

graphics processor often requiring hundreds of lines of such code. Logotypes

frequently executed with enviable craftsmanship, generally have a monumental

appearance of rock, metal or gothic horror dripping blood typography as

found on cinema posters or video cassette covers. Pictorial imagery where

used frequently conforms to a visual realism based on forms of popular science

fiction and fantasy illustration seen in the better comics, the work of

Boris Valejo, Roger Dean and similar. Musically, while early examples rely

on simple computer audio synthesis and a style similar to that heard in

games arcades, the sound which accompanies today's demos and intros is usually

considerably more sophisticated, employing digitised audio samples, sequenced

into the rhythms and treatments of popular music such as hip hop, acid,

funk, rap, techno and other variants, but with frequently elaborate melody

lines and variations, probably due to the technical limitations of including

vocal lyrics.</P>



<P></P>



<P>In addition to the customary musical accompaniment, demos and intros

also have been found to incorporate a number of standard components or parts:

a group logo, symbol or both (illustrations as examples of artistic prowess;

text messages or announcements delivered onto the screen by various routines

such as scrolling, zooming, pixel sprinkling, etc.; graphic and animation

routines; lists of greetings to other scene members; and the credits. These

elements might appear in any order or be integrated together in any
combination,

and while intros generally only contain one or two routines, a demo or mega

demo may present 20 routines or more. Scene diskzine publications such as

Eurochart, differentiate in their voting between single part demos which

load the complete program into RAM prior to playback, and multi-load demos

which continue to load segments during the demo presentation which can last

for more than half an hour of continually changing program content. Status

within the subculture accrues to individuals or groups on the basis of overall

design or demo structure, innovation in the implementation of graphics routines

or improvement upon existing ones as indicated above, and then as a result

of evidence of expertise in specific skill areas such as illustration or

musicianship.</P>



<P></P>



<P>DEMOS AND STATUS</P>



<P></P>



<P>Demonstration of superiority by these means within an international peer

group appears then to be a primary function of demos in the context of the

conclusions stated at the end of chapter 2. Competition and one-upmanship

appear to be more important motivators than announcement of presence in

the scene once groups have moved beyond a basic level of competence. New

groups make a point, perhaps apologetically, within their screen texts in

drawing attention to the fact of their first productions, while it is evident

that those already established, particularly when presenting new routines

for the first time, tend to be more assertive. The group Scoopex in their

1989 demo <I>MENTAL HANGOVER</I> (Plate 72) in which they introduced a stencil

vector routine among others, opened the presentation with the text &quot;THIS

ISN'T A FUCKING MEGADEMO. IT'S A SCOOPEX DEMO&quot; and closed with
&quot;ALWAYS

REMEMBER - SCOOPEX - GENERATIONS AHEAD&quot;, (Plate 73). Much of this type

of claim is puffery it seems in response to similar claims by other groups

(Plate 4, 1987 TechTech demo). Lord Helmet in his <I>Summary of the Year</I>

1991 (RAW DISKMAG #2), while acknowledging &quot;The best demo of 1990
[produced

1989] was Mental Hangover&quot;, also points out:</P>



<P></P>



<P>&quot;Look at the best demos of 1991. 3000% better. Just amazing how

fast the progress has gone. I think Scoopex slogan &quot;Light years
Ahead&quot;

should be changed to two months ahead. Because today Mental Hangover is

nothing. But Mental Hangover will be remembered as the first
&quot;trackmo&quot;

ever made! The credits in plane vector is copied thousands time by other&quot;

(Plate 14, Anarchy Digital Innovation).</P>



<P></P>



<P></P>



<P>THE SCENE</P>



<P></P>



<P>The social grouping identified for the purpose of this study then, is

that which can be identified by means of <I>sign equipment</I> known by

the terms: <I>demo, intro</I> or their immediate variants. Further, it can

be asserted therefore that these productions are a useful criterion for

defining a distinct subculture. The 765 examples of the genre obtained as

the study sample, revealed 398 named groups existing at various times between

1987 and 1993, proclaiming authorship of distinct examples of relevant genre,

ranging from the group <I>Anarchy</I> having 22 productions attributed to

it, down to the majority of groups, 266, each having only 1 production
attributed.

</P>



<P></P>



<P>As observed through scene publications and self references in their
productions,

the demo scene consists of three tiers. The individual, the group or team

and the scene. There is also strong evidence of the importance of status

of groups within the scene ranging from <I>elite</I> to <I>lame</I>. A
description

of scene stratification appeared in the diskzine <I>Freedom Crack</I> (issue

9, 1992) by scene member, Style of <I>Vega</I>:</P>



<P></P>



<P>Levels of the scene</P>



<P>I decided to write in article just to show you like the scene is in my

head, in fact in the brain of everybody. Just to show the different levels

of the scene. I classified the scene in two different things: the demo scene,

and the criminal scene. So here's the different category WITHOUT any group

name!</P>



<P></P>



<P>The demo scene: </P>



<P>[1] </P>



<P>Here we have the top elite of the scene. Cool groups with nice demos

and nice design, nice music, nice graphics, and fucking cool code. These

groups are at the tops of the charts, and they produce a lot of quality

stuff. They have also some BBS [Bulletin Board Systems], sometimes. </P>



<P>[2] </P>



<P>The groups who're in this section are also in the charts, sometimes for

diskmag, sometimes for cool demo, and they have very good reputation. They

own some BBS, and some swappers and this is why they are famous. They produce

also some cool demos, quality intros with nice design. </P>



<P>[3] </P>



<P>These groups are known, but they're not in any charts, coz they produce

a lot of intros, but not any cool demo/dentros. They prefer quantity than

quality, and this is why they're known. Some of them makes some quality

intros, but not more. </P>



<P>[4]</P>



<P>These groups are known only because they write articles for diskmag,

and only bcoz they swap with a lot of people. They're only `swapping group',

but they didn't produce anything. Some of them own some BBS, and they are

known in the modem scene. </P>



<P>[5]</P>



<P>They make 1 or 2 intro per year, just for fun, and they don't care about

the others groups of the scene. They just produce for themselves. </P>



<P>[6] </P>



<P>They're not known, but they think that they're pure elite bla bla. They

don't know anything of the scene, what means diskmag, they're just cli [command

line interface - standard operating system] demo makers, they also produce

demos and intros with demo makers [automated demo making utility software

- not individually coded]. </P>

elite mail trader and some elite modem trader.</P>



<P>[2] </P>



<P>They have some fast boards [BBS], some modem traders, and they make some

trainers [modified game software to give infinite lives etc.]. They are

the fastest trainers makers and have also a lot of credits in a lot of cool

BBS. </P>



<P>[3] </P>



<P>They have not any BBS. just some modem traders, and they make some trainers.

But they are not the fastest. </P>



<P>[4] </P>



<P>They make some trainer, sometimes a crack, but they havn't any modem

trader or any BBS, they just do it and spread the trainer or the crack by

mail. </P>



<P>[5]</P>



<P>They don't know what means BBS, modem traders, these groups think that

they can cracks games without problem, but they're just lame game players

who dream to crack and to make trainers.</P>

<P>Style's analysis recognises and differentiates two areas of endeavour

<P></P>



<P>STRUCTURE OF GROUPS WITHIN THE SUBCULTURE</P>



<P></P>



<P>The groups such as those identified, conform to Goffman's conceptual

model of group (Goffman E, <I>Encounters</I> (1961), Penguin University

Books 1972, p. 9), in that their &quot;properties include regulation for

entering and leaving; capacity for collective action; division of labor,

including leadership roles; socialisation function, whether primary or adult;

a means of satisfying personal ends; and latent and manifest social function

in the environing society.&quot; Of individuals within groups, Goffman states

&quot;....they perceive themselves as members who belong, identifying with

the organisation and receiving moral support for doing so; they sustain

a sense of hostility to outgroups. A symbolisation of the reality of the

group and one's relation to it is also involved.&quot; </P>



<P></P>



<P>Most of these features are clearly evident in the demo scene although

the associations which exist are not formalised in any conventionally official

sense. There is no governing body nor are there any written rules. There

are no geographical boundaries, even at group level membership is frequently

transnational and intercontinental. The factors which bind and define the

scene are interest in the productive potential of a common technology and

a mutual respect for skill in manipulating the technology beyond what is

supposed to be possible; an irreverent stepping beyond the edge in the
production

of audio visual artefacts which are the <I>symbolisation of the reality</I>

(Goffman 1961) of the group. Collective action and the division of labour

are prominently documented in the majority of productions with credits going

to such functionaries as <I>coders</I> (programmers), <I>graphicians</I>

or <I>artists, musicians, swappers, spreaders</I> (distributors), <I>mail

traders, modem traders</I> (software swappers using computer
telecommunications)

and <I>crackers</I> (commercial software protection code breakers). Leaders

are seldom mentioned though it is to be expected that since individuals

are variably motivated then decision making can be achieved in any of a

number of ways, and the function of organiser does occur. A typical group

membership is listed in <I>RAW DISKMAG #2</I> (1991): </P>

<P>While the majority of members functions within INFINITE PERFECTION appear

to be concerned with supplying, cracking and illegally redistributing
commercial

software rather than demo production the international profile is not unusual,

neither it is seen, is membership limited to a single group. The number

of BBS systems operators and modem traders listed also explains the rapid

international distribution of warez and demos once available. Group size

does vary considerably and is dependant upon factors such as length of
establishment

and priority of activity. Groups primarily concerned with software acquisition

and redistribution clearly benefit from large size and wide distribution

whereas an emphasis on demo creation may be more efficient with a small

number and close proximity. A typical smaller group for example is

<P>I have been asked this question several times recently. So here, free

with this issue of Grapevine, is your very own print-out-and-keep guide

to who's who in CNX. We are a fairly new group, therefore we haven't yet

got as many members as we would like. At the time of writing (17/8/92) CNX

consists of the following people; </P>



<P></P>



<P>STORM - Spends many of his waking hours staring at Xcopy. You guessed

it, Storm is a mail swapper, because that's what he does best. </P>



<P></P>



<P>BOOTLEGGER - Bootlegger codes games and stuff. And that's it really.

</P>



<P></P>



<P>ROMBUST - CNX's resident boffin, Rombust likes nothing better than fiddling

around with Devpac [assembler programming software] for hours on end. He's

coded no end of games, which have gained high praise from paper mag reviewers.

He's also a cracker, which is a shame, because we've got fuck all originals

for him at the moment! </P>



<P></P>



<P>MEGADETH - The Glasgow street artist draws kewl logos 'n' stuff. </P>



<P></P>



<P>HOBBiT - The &quot;leader&quot; of the group. Also runs the CNX WHQ (contact

address and official swapping address). Spends most of his waking hours

Xcopying, since he swaps with an horrendous amount of contacts. But he still

finds time to fulfil hisother group role - that of total weirdo and sick

pervert. This makes him the ideal Grapevine writer! </P>



<P></P>



<P>DAN - Dan not only codes, but draws as well. What a guy! </P>



<P></P>



<P>MAD PHANTOM - Mad Phantom composes mad music in his saner moments (i.e.

not very often!) </P>



<P></P>



<P>ST. MICHAEL - In between chillin' out around Fleet, Hants (well, someone's

got to live there!), St.M often finds time to casually chuck a few jiffies

in the postbox. So that's why his postman's not got any kids.... (Bit obscure

that one, think about it!) For joining our friendly, productive group (NOT

a bunch of losers with no coders! ehehe) then write to me, Hobbit, at:</P>

insight it provides to what may be a typical sequence of events:</P>

<P>A N E X - L A M E R S S T O R Y - By CARDIAXX of WDL </P>



<P></P>



<P>I was one of those who started with computers by playing games at the

old 'n' rusty [Commodore] 64. I was just starting to learn basic and had

done some lame productions and of ours some crappy demos at the Pro Demo

Creator [software for making demos without programming] (I'll bet that it

ain't one who can't remember the old PDC). Then a friend of mine bought

the ultimate machine: The Amiga 500 1.2. I must admit: I got pretty angry.</P>



<P></P>



<P>There he was with his powerful tool of an machine. Graphics which were

unthinkable. The computer freaks-dream. An Ultimate tool of the Gods. Well,

I still managed with my 64, but it wasn't the same. Then another friend

of mine got this power-tool in his possession. I was getting green of envy.

But as the strong dude I am, I still managed with my 64. Then the 3rd of

my friends bought an Amiga. I then decided, I want a taste of heaven. I

looked in the local paper and what did I see....</P>



<P>FOR SALE </P>



<P>Amiga 500 1.2 with sampler, </P>



<P>genlock and 100 disks. </P>



<P>5000 NOK call *** **** </P>



<P></P>



<P>I was in the seventh heaven. An AMIGA, so cheap. With so much so I called

the number, like in a dream. &quot;Yes, **** here&quot;, it answered. &quot;Are

you the fellow who's selling an AMIGA.&quot; , I said. &quot;Yes, but I

am sorry to say that its already sold. Sorry.&quot; </P>



<P></P>



<P>My world was in pieces. I could cry. Well, I thought a little. I said

to myself.... &quot;How, where and by which way.... I WANT AN AMIGA NOW!&quot;

The next day I grabbed 7000 NOK from my bank account, ran to the local computer

shop, threw the dosh on the counter and said &quot;An Amiga 500 1.3,
please&quot;.

I got a joystick (arcade) and a 512 kb extra memory. I carried it home.

And then plundered my friends for games.</P>



<P></P>



<P>I sat 3 days and 3 nights playing. Then I fell asleep next to my AMIGA.

I soon realised that you could to other things with the Amiga than play

old, crappy games. So I started playing new, stunning games. I was in heaven.

I got myself some contacts. and every day I got new [pirated]games: Shadow

of the Beast, Pirates, Crazy Cars II, Test Drive 2 and F18 Interceptor was

just some of the games I got. </P>



<P></P>



<P>Me and a fellow decided to start a group. We called us the extremely

original name: A-TEAM (I'm sure there is 50 groups with that name). We found

out the secret of making a startup-sequence together [initialisation software

which runs from a program disk] . And we made a tool[utility program] disc

on 2 disks. We used 2 months. </P>



<P></P>



<P>We was now a good (we thought) group. Some couple of guys from Yakutza

came over and looked at our tool disk. &quot;Wow!&quot; they said and asked

if we wanted to join them. We didn't, because we were pro's. After a long

period of time, we found out that it was on time to change name. We got

the name: Conspiracy. And as I had got my hands on Rsi Demomaker [software

for making demos without programming frowned upon as a lame method by bona

fide demo coders], we made a &quot;stunning&quot; megademo. And we arranged

our first copy party. We were the huge amount of 11 people on that party.</P>



<P></P>



<P>We were all a bunch of x-copy [fast disk duplication software bypassing

some copy protection schemes] turtles. We made more lame tool disks and

a couple of &quot;megademos&quot;. Then I got tired of Conspiracy and joined

a self made group called TRIXEL with Dr. D which then was a member of the

false PIRATES. He showed me the secrets of ProTracker 1.1b [audio sequencing

software for creating music]. I was now a musician....</P>



<P></P>



<P>My first module [a music sequence file format] was horrible. I did manage

the rhythm and bass from the beginning. It was the melody I had trouble

with. Well, Trixel joined &quot;Pirates&quot; (I thought this was the real

PIRATES) and we gave out some total HORRIBLE Music disks. (Well, not that

horrible. I made two AWESOME mixes. (I was starting to get the hang of it).

</P>



<P></P>



<P>I quit PIRATES and joined ROBO-TEAM. I was now a novice musician. I managed

(to a certain point) the melodies. And made two musax disks. I made some

cool musax like Dream Child and so on.... I got tired of RBT and joined

EXTENSION and made a musax disk. But a guy there made me pissed of. So I

again made a group with Dr. D called POWERMINDS.</P>



<P></P>



<P>We arranged a party with 24 people at the most. It was a success. We

made Jukebox 1 and 2 at that party. These musax disks was average. We didn't

have a coder, so we made everything in CLI. I got fed up with Dr. D after

making Jukebox III. He was from BERGEN. I got an offer from RBT (again)

about joining them. I accepted one 1 condition. If the changed their name.

We agreed on WEDLOCK. But a few days later I heard from a pal that The Hitcher

said that I wasn't a member anyway, because the other members didn't agree

to change the name. (bet he didn't ask them).</P>



<P></P>



<P>Me and Fairbrain then made our own group and called it WEDLOCK. We made

a couple of musax disk (Beatbox 1,2,3) We do now have a coder so Beatbox

4 will be an improvement compared to my other productions. We have arranged

a party which was a success (40 people). We got sponsor deals and got a

lot of money (400Kr each at 4 people) but we could have got more if The

Hicther/RBT hadn't screwed up. He didn't charge ticket price from 15 people

(1125 kr).</P>



<P></P>



<P>Well, Some may say that I am still a beginner. Yes, I agree to that if

they compare me to for example: Fleshbrain, Jesper Kyd etc. But I at least

try to learn something instead of complaining and talking. (Hear, Hear Vortex).

Now two of my friends got A2000 with hard disk and one got CDTV. I want

an A2000. Our group still needs a coder so write to....</P>

<P></P>



<P>AGE AND GENDER</P>



<P></P>



<P>The study of the collected materials indicates the demo scene as evidently

consisting almost entirely of adolescent male youth. While direct observation

of the genre materials themselves does not provide much corroborative textual

evidence of this since the participants and producers almost in every case

use pseudonyms, some speculative conclusions are nevertheless possible.

The members of the most prolific group encountered in the study, Anarchy

at some time in 1992 were for example Rush, Icronite, Milkshake, Sunjohn,

Slash, Madfreak, Maestro and Trix in Denmark; Performer, Ronan, Audiomonster,

NHP, BKK, DCA, Zoom, Rasputin, Rookie, Surferand Conquest in France; Dan,

Nuke, Krest, Critical Mass, Mystic, Kris, Del, Mole, Mr Big and Judge Drock

in England; Facet in Holland, Pinny in Germany and Trillion in the USA (Judge

Drokk, <I>Anarchy: Members and Management</I>, RAW DISKMAG #2, PMC, 1992).

Since these are pseudonyms or handles in the vernacular, there can only

be general assumption as to their gender when seen in credit lists or greetings

scrolltexts. Further reading in this instance shows Judge Drokk in describing

his role as organiser of Anarchy, alluding to the group members gender in

the sentence &quot;I believe you must never put pressure onto one of your

members, you have to respect your members as individuals, each with lots

of things in <I>his</I> life except [in addition to] <I>his</I> group&quot;.

</P>



<P></P>



<P>Interviews, reports, advertisements and in some instance photographs

in the various scene diskzines serve to further confirm the assumption of

the male gender orientation of the subculture. Numerous examples of
individual's

contact details have been found to include both pseudonym and real name.

For instance in issue 1 of <I>HEXAGONE / PARASITE</I>, a French scene diskzine

published on September 25, 1992 by the French Group INTENSE, provides contact

details of the individual group members with their real names as well as

alias handles. No female group member names were encountered in the
<I>HEXAGONE/PARASITE</I>

publication. Similarly, it has been found that articles in such publications

infer the male gender almost exclusively when referring to individuals in

the scene. Some typical extracts here taken from <I>RAW DISKMAG #2</I>
published

by PURE METAL CODERS in early 1992 illustrates:</P>



<P></P>



<P>Hawkeye left Static Bytes and joined [Kefrens] along with <I>his</I>

board [BBS]</P>



<P>`Dreamland'. He also changed <I>his</I> handle to Stormbringer.</P>



<P></P>



<P>Gadget of Cytax joined due to internal problems in Cytax Sweden. <I>He</I>

also changed </P>



<P>his handle, after many tries he decided to stick with Logic.</P>



<P></P>



<P>Bold Eagle has shut down <I>his</I> board `The Abyzz' due to personal

problems.</P>



<P></P>



<P>The happiest musician in 1991 must be TIP. In 1990 <I>he</I> was dust,

in 1991 <I>he's</I> gold.</P>



<P></P>



<P>Also here we have <I>a guy</I> who has taken the whole table. I am talking

about Uno of Scoopex. </P>



<P></P>



<P>Yes you read right! Even boring Amiga Freaks can get HIV... The person

I am talking about is Rizzo/ The Silents. <I>He</I> is a sysop on
Cyberdyne.</P>



<P></P>



<P>Uncharacteristically the same issue of RAW carries an interview article

by Lord Helmet of Pure Metal Coders, <I>CHAT WITH SEXY AMIGA GIRL</I>, 16

year old Wiquie of Linkoping, Sweden, a female member of the group Cytax.

Unlike the interview articles generally dwelling upon supposedly male scene

members' interests such as scene business, demo making, group administration,

competition organisation and demo evaluation, the interview with Wiquie

consists of essentially sexist chit chat on the subject of her preferences

in the opposite gender. Only one question addresses a remotely technical

issue:</P>



<P></P>



<P>&quot;Lord Helmet: Why do you think that so few girls are attracted to

the computer? Wiqui: Girls are smart, boys are stupid!&quot;</P>



<P></P>



<P>Perhaps significantly, Wiquie of CYTAX was not reported as having a handle

or pseudonym as is customary for male group members. In that context, the

article by way of introduction infers that Wiqui might be more a decorative

appendage to the group rather than active functionary, and simply states:</P>



<P>&quot;The group is CYTAX. Her handle is being cute.&quot; </P>



<P></P>



<P>The issue of gender orientation with regard to the development of interest

in computer technology is usefully discussed by Dr. Leslie Haddon in her

essay <I>Interactive Games</I> (Hayward P [edited by], Culture, Technology

&amp; Creativity in the Late Twentieth Century, John Libbey, London 1992,

p. 123-147). Haddon concludes that while girls enjoyment of computer games,

including those of a fast action arcade nature, was no less enthusiastic

that of boys, discourse on the topic of computers, the exchange of games

and game playing tips outside of the game playing environment was found

not to be regarded with the same degree of priority or importance by girls.

Haddon indicates that for boys, conversation about technical issues such

as computer games and computers can serves an important socialising function.

Haddon also observes that the opportunity for socialising available in
electronic

games arcades, socially acceptable and popular as gathering places for male

youth interested in computer games and their technologies has been generally

denied girls due to a somewhat unsavoury perception of such places by parents.

The kind of sustained ongoing preoccupation with technology which might

consequently develop in a substantial proportion of the male gender is not

according to Haddon therefore shared by their female counterparts who otherwise

engage with the same computer game texts as the males with equal enthusiasm.

</P>



<P></P>



<P>Recent research conducted by Dr. Valerie Clarke and Joy Teague, both

of Deakin University in Australia, would appear to confirm Haddons conclusions

concerning social influences. On the basis of research data collected over

three years, Clarke and Teague report, though in the context of gender balance

in computer education rather than leisure computing, that &quot;low numbers

of girls and women in computer science classes appears to be related to

societal factors rather than to gender&quot; (Clarke VA, Teague GJ<I>,
Encouraging

Girls to Study Computer Science - Should We Even Try?</I>, Australian
Educational

Computing, Vol. 9 No.1, May 1994, p 17-22, 32). </P>



<P></P>



<P>Dr. Sadie Plant in her article <I>Beyond The Screens: Film, Cyberpunk

and Feminism</I> (Variant, issue 14, Glasgow 1994, p. 12-18), asserts a

far deeper culturally ingrained position characterising the attitudes to

technology of men and women. Her article describes the marginalisation of

womens' speech by the &quot;dominant [male] system of communication&quot;

which has been technology oriented. Further, Plant states that &quot;The

connection between women and technology has been sedimented in patriarchal

myth: machines were female because they were mere things on which men
worked&quot;.

Against this background Plant sees a future in which non linear, Hypertext

like, computer mediated communication, parallelling the &quot;immediacy

of women's communion with each other&quot;, as posing a challenging alternative

and &quot;disrupting every conception of the straightforward [male]
narrative.&quot;

Cyberfeminity, a virtual reality, she concludes, is a process through which

preferable alternatives might be asserted to the control oriented and
destructive

history of man's achievements. </P>



<P></P>



<P>While Haddon, Clark and Teague present a view describing the female gender

as being at least equally effective to the male when operating within a

computing environment, though without the preoccupation characterising male

involvement with the technology as a factor of peer group socialisation,

Plant presents a scenario of the linguistically framed and culturally
maintained

disadvantage of women as an opportunity to impact upon the status quo due

to a common communication paradigm, that of networking, now occurring within

electronic communication infrastructures. Both the reason of socially
constrained

opportunity as stated by Haddon and that of linguistic determination as

asserted by Plant lends credence to the assumption that the demo scene is

predominantly a male subculture. Both may be viewed as corollary to recent

findings in the USA indicating that 80% of homes with boys between the ages

of 8 to 16 have a games computer (Battelle J, Johnstone B, <I>The Next Level:

Sega's Plans for World Domination</I>, Wired, USA vol.1.6, Dec. 1993. p.

73-77, 128-131). </P>



<P></P>



<P>GATHERINGS</P>



<P></P>



<P>A further feature of the scene are the gatherings of members. These could

be simply copy parties for the purpose of fellowship software copying with

as few as 3 or 4 attendees in some one's home, however some are large events

usually planned some months in advance and involve the hire of a venue and

provision for a range of technical and logistic conference type requirements.

These are usually hosted by well established groups with a significant
reputation

in the scene and can attract upwards of 500 attendees. In terms of their

agenda these larger events are very similar in their social function to

the cultural festivals which feature in mainstream society such as the
Eisteddfod

in Wales, film festivals etc. These gatherings or parties provide an
opportunity

for members from various groups and locations to meet, exchange ideas and

warez and compete. Categories for competition are usually best demo, best

intro, best music, best graphics and sometimes there might be a coding competition

to produce an intro or short demo during the time of the party usually two

days. Voting is by the attendees and prizes are awarded either in the form

of cash from the sale of tickets for the event, or sometimes hardware, software

and/or cash from sponsorship. Following the competition, compilations of

the winners and runners up are produced and distributed. These events are

frequently the opportunity for groups to launch new demos at the same time

providing an infrastructure, informal and spontaneous as it is, for
establishing

and updating qualitative benchmarks for the scene's cultural productions.

These productions thus become the principal form of <I>sign equipment</I>

for groups with which to denote status and standing within the subculture.</P>



<P></P>



<P>TOWARDS AN UNDERSTANDING OF MOTIVATION </P>



<P></P>



<P>As earlier discussed, the production of demos frequently represents an

enormous investment in time and commitment for the individuals concerned.

The issue of motivation therefore arises. The reward from winning competitions

offering computer hardware or peripherals or a cash amount of between $200

- $500 while to a high school student, a typical group member, might seem

substantial, once split up among individuals in a group as in the case of

cash, financially is unlikely to cover international or even local travelling

expenses to attend such an event. Also it is thought to be a fair assumption

that only a minority of the total number of demos produced are done so with

the intention of demo competition entry. The reasons being that competition

standard is generally known to be high, being set by elite groups with a

track record. This factor of standard and difficulty in it's attainment

is not insignificant when taken in the context of the scene as a whole.

As already indicated, analysis of the research sample data shows that of

the 398 scene groups identified only 132 or roughly one third have made

more than one production of any kind. A further consideration against
competition

entry being a prime motivator is that as a rule, in order to enter members

of the production group must be present. A travel expense probably too high

for many. </P>



<P></P>



<P>SELF PROMOTION</P>



<P></P>



<P>What is overtly evident is that there are several examples where the

content invites response from entities other than members of the underground

scene. Within the music tracks for instance, in place of instrument names

of the sound files used there is to be found information how a software

house or other interested parties might contact the composer in order to

commission music. Graphicians or electronic illustrators and designers
generally

sign their work and certainly the coders or programmers are aware that software

companies may talent spot. Indeed some groups have in due course developed

commercial software, for example the group <I>Silents</I> who have written

the top selling games <I>Pinball Dreams</I> followed by <I>Pinball
Fantasies</I>,

both released for the IBM PC as well as the Amiga. Demos in these instances

become the vehicle for skill exposition and perform the same function that

a showreel might for a film production company. Some examples offer demo

production as a financial proposition to potential clients including other

scene groups who may not possess within their ranks the skills to produce

their own demo. Occasionally a sub-theme within a demo might be derision

or a challenge with regard to another group. In the main however, the messages

carried in scrolling text form, against a background of visual effects deal

with self acclamation with regard to the producers and the expression of

friendship and acknowledgment towards the scene of which the producers see

themselves as a part of. This acknowledgment of others is a feature in the

majority of demos and is referred to as the <I>greetings list</I>. Here,

several dozen names of other groups or pseudonyms of individuals might scroll

by during the course of a demo.</P>



<P></P>



<P>The demo as a means of posturing for status within a social structure

in terms of stratification within the subculture is also worthy of noting

as a factor in the motivation of individual and group effort. An established

perception with regard to degrees of achievement in terms of accomplishments

which are valued and admired within the subculture community as a whole

create distinctions of status. These distinctions or pursuit of the values

they represent are reasons for example why members may migrate between groups

or why groups dissolve, disperse and re-emerge under different names.</P>



<P></P>



<P>THE DEMO MAKERS PERSPECTIVE</P>



<P></P>



<P>Recorded interviews with demo makers are rare in conventional paper
publications

and only two have been located in the course of the study. Shatz in his

<I>Walkthroughs and Flybys</I> CD publication does no more than report
sentiments

though not direct quotations in his discussion of the Finnish PC demo group

Future Crew and their founder Sami Tammilehto. Shatz reports:</P>



<P></P>



<P>&quot;In the next year, they plan to start writing games for a US based

company to break into the multimedia industry. Regardless, they intend to

keep creating demos and distributing them for free because they have so

much fun doing so. What they enjoy most of all is the competition and sharing

of Ideas with other groups in the demo community&quot;.</P>



<P></P>



<P>A verbatim interview published in <I>The Australian Commodore &amp; Amiga

Review</I> (James O<I>, The C64 Column</I>, April 1992, p 56) between Owen

James and Slash (Damien Britt) of the Digital Underground elaborates
further:</P>



<P></P>



<P>OJ: Why spend so much time coding a demo that will probably be forgotten

in a couple of weeks? </P>



<P>DB: We try and make the demos so that they are remembered and not just

forgotten. Um, it could be ego related as well, because a lot of the disk

magazines produce charts from people voting, and getting Number One is probably

what most people aim for. Mainly it is just for fun and experience I
suppose.</P>



<P>OJ: What are your average ages?</P>



<P>DB: It would probably be about 16 or 17, but can range from anywhere

from 13 to 60. Most of us are still going to school and are still enjoying

our youth. OJ: Do you find it interferes with your social lives?</P>



<P>DB: Not really. You code in your spare time, when you want as there aren't

exactly deadlines, though sometimes there is! We just go and enjoy our normal

lives and code in spare time. It actually enhances your social life in a

way, because when you swap it is just like having lots of pen pals, and

there are usually parties and things where you can meet these other people

on the `scene', as we call it. Also if you are travelling, you know a lot

of people and you can go and meet them etc.</P>



<P>OJ: How did you get onto the demo scene?</P>



<P>DB: Firstup, I was asked by somebody at school, and we formed a small

local &quot;lamer&quot; group. However we slowly improved and got more
recognition.

Have you seen addresses in demos? Well, you write to them and ask to swap

and slowly build up from there.</P>



<P>OJ: Any last thoughts or deep and meaningful philosophies on life or

anything else?</P>



<P>DB:.... If people think they are interested, then they should give it

a go as it is challenging, fun and fulfilling. It gives you experience in

programming and a lot of the scene guys go on to become game coders and

doing other things for software houses. </P>



<P></P>



<P>An interview with Mr Hyde, demo coder of the Swedish group Anromeda in

RAW diskmag (Issue 2, 1991, item 45) provides a little further insight:</P>



<P></P>



<P>Q: Is it hard to find new ideas to code? </P>



<P>A: It's not hard to find ideas, but it's hard to find good ideas. Most

often ideas pop up at school when we are having a boring lesson. </P>



<P>Q: What is your motivation to use so much time to code demos? </P>



<P>A: Sugarcubes (Not the pop group, real ones!), and the great force called

&quot;code-gleden.</P>



<P></P>



<P>Philipetto of Vega poses a more philosophical stance on the issue and

offers some salutary advice to aspirants and colleagues alike:</P>



<P></P>



<P>Now, all democoders have to face that it happened at least one time that

someone asked them: &quot;but why do you spend so much time on such a useless

thing?&quot;You can't deny it: demos are useless. They can be as nice as

you want but they are made just to be shown.</P>



<P>Before going on, I want to determine a thing: I'm not against demos at

all, because I have composed about 40 tunes for demos and I have coded about

20 demos. I have already shown the bad part of democoding: at the end of

the work you have a thing which after being watched one time will be forgotten

(I know that the great demos are always remembered, but it's a bit strange

that a guy spends his whole day watching the same demo 100 times)</P>



<P>The good thing of democoding is that the coder makes experiences and

starts to know the machine. This is a very positive fact and it's very useful

for the future.Now, demos should be the favourite hobby of a democoder.

And this is OK, too. But the democoding must not overlap the other facts

of life of a guy, because otherwise the guy after some years will find himself

with 3-4 wasted years, and I mean wasted in doing nothing for his life,

because you can be as famous as you want in the scene, but REAL life is

completely different.</P>



<P>..... Life flows around the money. This is a fact. Have you ever asked

yourself why actually all the best coders and musicians (and graphicians)

work for software houses?</P>



<P>..... So, if you are really good, don't work only for the scene. Software

houses are always looking for talented people. Get the chance to earn some

money.&quot; </P>



<P>(Filipetto of Vega, Why Coding Demos?, Freedom Crack 9, 1992)</P>



<P></P>



<P>MASLOW'S HUMANIST PHILOSOPHY</P>



<P></P>



<P>In many respects a scene member's devotion of hundreds of hours in the

production of a demo for little reward other than &quot;fun and
fulfillment&quot;,

as Damien Britt alias Slash who is quoted above stated; can be asserted,

is no different than for example, a model engineering hobbyist spending

a year or two painstakingly manufacturing a 1/20th full working scale model

of a steam locomotive. A further parallel might be drawn between what might

be interpreted as the obsessive dedication to the task undertaken by demo

makers and the &quot;fanatical enthusiasm&quot; exhibited by <I>otaku</I>,

Japanese &quot;teens or tweens mostly boys&quot; for collecting artefacts

or knowledge connected with some commodity or media type as a &quot;maniac

field of interest&quot; (Grassmuck V<I>, Otaku - Japanese kids colonise

the realm of information and media</I>, Mediamatic, Vol 5, No 4, 1990),

(Greenfeld K T, <I>The Incredibly Strange Mutant Creatures Who Rule The

Universe of Alienated Japanese Zombie Computer Nerds (Otaku to You),</I>

Wired, Vol 1, No 1, 1992, p 66-68) . Only the context changes. It is the

urge and conviction to persist which, it is concluded, is the more significant

similarity between the products of the demo scene and those of the artists

and film makers referred to in chapter 1, and not the formal features of

the artefacts themselves for which no evidence has been found for intentional

commonality in the visual references of the more recent to the former.</P>



<P></P>



<P>Fun and a sense of fulfilment are human responses to the satisfaction

of a felt need or urge. A. H. Maslow's writings on the subject of
self-actualisation

and creativity provide within the parameters of this study the most
satisfactory

answer to the issue of the motivation involved. In his book (Maslow A H,

<I>The Farther Reaches of Human Nature</I> (1971), Penguin, 1978) Maslow

debates the question of intrinsic values in human nature. He postulates

that creativeness is an intrinsic characteristic of humanity. His main thesis

concerns the holistic nature of the person and the ill effects on well being

or <I>metapathologies</I> which occur as a result of the denial of opportunity

for the actualisation of such intrinsic traits. In discussing this postulate,

Maslow differentiates between the motivation involved in the satisfaction

of basic human needs, into which category he includes &quot;belongingness,

affection, respect and self esteem&quot; (<I>A theory of metamotivation:

The Biological Rooting of the Value Life</I>, The Farther Reaches of Human

Nature, chapter 23), and the dynamics which then motivate the self-actualising

persons further, in terms of dedication, self sacrifice, devotion to a cause,

aspiration, anger etc. Maslow calls this higher level drive ,
&quot;metamotivation&quot;.

He points out that mere gratification of the basic needs can in it's self

be compatible with &quot;existential neurosis&quot; that is meaninglessness,

valuelessness and the like. Self actualising individuals on the other hand,

he points out are dedicated people devoted to some task or vocation
&quot;outside

themselves&quot;. They have a passion and profound feeling for their work.

In this situation &quot;internal requiredness coincides with external
requiredness&quot;.

Employment, voluntary service in some capacity or requested tasks are perceived

by self actualising individuals as self indulgence, a pleasure, rather than

duty or imposed necessity. The task is felt to provide a release for one

or other intrinsic human trait such as creativity and therefore facilitates

fulfilment. As a result, opportunity for self actualisation translates into

manifestations of fine craftsmanship for example, selfless devotion in helping

others or the pursuit and delight in excellence of achievement. Such
individuals,

Maslow has also found by research, &quot;quite easily and decisively &quot;know

right from wrong&quot; for themselves&quot;, and the assertion is made that

the denial of self actualisation can manifest as value confusion and an

&quot;active hatred of the good (or trying to become good) person, or
superiority,

excellence, beauty, talent, etc.&quot;; [hence possibly the delight in sabotage

and chaos as discussed earlier in connection with the writings of Taylor

and Walton (Images of Deviance), and the observations of Hebdige concerning

youth culture].</P>



<P></P>



<P>The intrinsic human values which <I>metamotivate</I> self actualising

individuals, Maslow asserts are &quot;instinctoid in nature, i.e., they

are needed (a) to avoid illness and (b) to achieve fullest humanness of

growth. The &quot;illnesses&quot; resulting from deprivation of intrinsic

values (metaneeds) we may call metapathologies&quot;. These
<I>metapathologies</I>

which result from the denial of opportunity for self actualisation include:

Alienation, Loss of Zest in Life, Meaninglessness, Boredom, Philosophical

crisis, Apathy, resignation and fatalism, Desacralization of life, Joylessness,

Cynicism, and &quot;Aimless&quot; destructiveness, resentment and vandalism.

</P>



<P></P>



<P>The kinds of &quot;Pathogenic Deprivation&quot; which leads to the above

&quot;Metapathologies&quot; are for example: </P>



<P>Dishonesty - [denying] Truth - [leading to] Disbelief, mistrust, cynicism,

scepticism and suspicion; Ugliness - [denying] Beauty - [leading to] Vulgarity,

Specific unhappiness, restlessness, loss of taste, tension, fatigue,
Philistinism

and Bleakness; Deadness, Mechanizing of life - [denying] Aliveness Process

- [leading to] Deadness, Robotising, Feeling oneself to be totally determined,

Loss of emotion, Boredom, and Experiential emptiness; Injustice - [denying]

Justice - [leading to] Insecurity, Anger, cynicism, lawlessness, jungle

world view and total selfishness.</P>



<P>(extract: Maslow, Table 3, B-Values and specific Metapathologies) </P>



<P></P>



<P>Maslow concludes, &quot;The metaneeds [truth, goodness, perfection, justice,

etc.] seem to me to be instinctoid, that is, to have an appreciable hereditary,

species-wide determination. But they are potentialities rather than actualities.

Culture is definitely and absolutely needed for their actualisation; but

also culture can fail to actualise them....&quot;.</P>



<P></P>



<P>CONCLUSION</P>



<P></P>



<P>It is a conclusion of the present study that a human pre-disposition

to self actualisation in the terms which Maslow postulates, substantially

provides a plausible hypothesis regarding the underlying motivation for

the frequently long and sustained co-operative effort required for demo

production. It seems that the technological capability of the computer and

the camaraderie of peers, provides the opportunity for self actualisation

to occur. It is an opportunity to strive to excel and achieve in the face

of what might appear to be an unsatisfactory and hypocritical cultural and

social external environment. It is noted however that this predisposition

for self actualisation is equal for any domain of endeavour that might be

determined through the enculturation of the individual.</P>



<P></P>



<P>Analysis of the collected study materials has revealed a scale of production

unanticipated at the investigations commencement. The 743 individual examples

of the genre identified, and catalogued together with evidence in the form

of 34 hours of video recorded excerpts it is asserted, constitutes a
significantly

substantial basis for the recognition of a cultural phenomenon. Further,

the identified and collected internal scene publications give weight to

the identification of a distinct and significant trans-national male gender

based, youth subculture. It is a subculture which effectively exists on

anarchistic principles, inasmuch as it survives on the basis of liberty

and co-operation in the absence of coercive or cohesive structural influence.

The productions, demos and intros, created within this environment function

both as the sign equipment of the subculture and as a means of self expression

and self actualisation for the individuals involved. These productions have

also been found to present certain characteristics which in combination

distinguish the genre sufficiently from other existing kinetic audio visual

media genre types to warrant the genre's recognition as a specific and distinct

type of cultural artefact. These are the routines and the essentially
non-narrative

format of their presentation. Series of technical exercises as demonstrations

of prowess and mastery of their medium of expression, though with their

musical presentation context also involving creativity in their choreography

therefore resulting in a type of vernacular audio visual art form. The author

concludes that these findings supported by the diversity of the materials

identified, and the now available information resources through the Internet

communication resource, are sufficient to constitute a significant cyber

subculture.</P>
