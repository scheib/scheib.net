<H2><A name=begin>Programming Technique + Art = Demo</A></H2>
<P>Computer demos should not be confused with the demo versions of commercial 
programs. They are "demos" too, but the word "demo" in this text means a program 
whose purpose is to present the technical and artistic skills of its makers and 
produce audiovisual pleasure to the viewer. A computer demo usually includes 
various kind of real-time produced computer graphics effects which have little 
relation to each other accompanied by music. In a way a demo could be described 
as a sort of music video or a short computer animation film without a plot or 
message other than just "hey, I can do this" and "greetings to my friends". Of 
course there is exception to every rule and some demos have a plot and message. 
An important distinction between demos and movies or videos is that the visual 
effects seen in demos are real-time calculated, instead of rendered in 
beforehand like conventional computer animations (where often hours of computer 
time are spent to calculate just one frame).</P>
<P>Most computer demos are freeware, in other words they can be freely copied, 
but the original author retains copyright to the product. The authors computer 
demos don't usually release the source code and thus the demo programmers must 
figure out by themselves how to produce a certain demo effect, leading to many 
similar looking demos ("I can also do it!"). People who have never seen computer 
demos or who don't understand the creation process behind demos, often find 
computer demos quite boring. Computer demos are made for other other people 
interested in demos, to win fame and glory among other demo freaks. Nowadays the 
motivation to make demos is often a price to win at demo competitions.</P>
<P>Demos are usually a group effort. The most important member of a demo group 
is usually the coder (programmer). Demos are conventionally programmed in <A 
href="http://www.astentech.com/tutorials/Assembly.html">assembler</A>, but 
nowadays <A href="http://www.ioccc.org/">C</A> and <A 
href="http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk/~msgrant/faq.html">C++</A> are also popular, and 
only the most time-critical parts of the demos are programmed in hand-optimized 
assembler. The original ideology of the demo programmers is to build everything 
from scratch (instead of using existing programming libraries) and push the 
hardware to its limits and beyond it. E.g. many C64 and Atari ST exploit bugs in 
hardware which allow some interesting effects e.g. to draw graphics on screen 
borders (overscan / full screen). The sound of chips of C64 (<A 
href="http://stud1.tuwien.ac.at/~e9426444/">SID</A>) or Atari ST (<A 
href="http://www.brainbug.ch/stsound/">YM2149</A>) are not designed to play 
samples, but still demo coders have managed to do this. Demo effects are usually 
non-interactive, which allows demo coders to hand-tune routines to do 
exactly-what-is shown and not worry about anything else. Whereas game 
programmers must use more general purpose routines and include interaction. Demo 
coders often use clever tricks and actual cheating to make things look better 
than they really are. In addition to the coder, there is usually a musician and 
a graphician (graphics artist) and contact personnel (swappers, SysOp). One 
person can of course takes care of several of these duties and there can be 
several programmers, musicians etc. Typically a demo group has 2-15 members, but 
there are several lone wolves in the demo scene.</P>
<H2><A name=scene>The Demo Scene</A></H2>
<P>People who are interested in demos are called the demo scene. Organized demo 
scene began to form on the mid-1980's. During those early days the most popular 
demo machines were <A 
href="http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/~alexios/MACHINE-ROOM/Commodore_Amiga_1000.html">Commodore 
Amiga</A>, <A 
href="http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/~alexios/MACHINE-ROOM/Commodore_64.html">Commodore 
64</A> (C64) and <A 
href="http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/~alexios/MACHINE-ROOM/Atari_520ST.html">Atari 
ST</A>. <A 
href="http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/~alexios/MACHINE-ROOM/Apple_Macintosh.html">Apple 
Macintosh</A> was never a popular demo platform. The first <A 
href="http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/~alexios/MACHINE-ROOM/IBM_PC.html">PC</A>s 
usually had poor graphics and sound capabilities. Since emergence of <A 
href="http://gameprogrammer.com/3-tweak.html">VGA</A> graphics and <A 
href="http://www.gate.net/~shipbrk/sb.html">Adlib/SoundBlaster</A> sound cards 
allowed a good demos to made on PCs, but it took many years for PC scene to 
learn to program these well. The ST scene began to diminish after the first 
years of 1990's and the PC demo scene began to rise. Nowadays the PC is the most 
popular demo machine. C64 and Amiga demo scene are still existing. Yes, some 
people still make demos for C64, but nowadays it is more of nostalgic 
curiosity.</P>
<P>The demo hobby is centered in Europe, there are little demos makers in other 
continents Majority of leading demo groups come from Northern Europe. Finland 
could perhaps be titled as the leading demo country, because Finns have gathered 
more winning positions on major demos parties than any other country. The 
Scandinavian countries have more demo freaks per capita than other 
countries.</P>
<P>It is difficult to estimate the actual size of demo scene, but there are at 
least several thousand people in Finland who are interested in demos.</P>
<H2><A name=parties>Demo Parties</A></H2>
<P><IMG height=297 alt="" src="index_files/halli4.jpe" width=430></P>
<P><EM>Overview from Assembly'95 (Helsinki ice hall)</EM></P>
<P>Demo scene members organize big meetings, called demo parties. They usually 
last few days and contain so much different kind of events that the attenders 
rarely get a good night's sleep. People go to demo parties to meet other demo 
scene members, swap software, play multi-player network games and watch and 
attend to various kinds of <A 
href="#competitions">competitions</A>. 
The best competition entries are usually rewarded with prices: money and 
computer products from sponsors.</P>
<P>On big demo parties the number of entries for a competition can be very 
large. A small jury consisting of scene members first reviews the entries and a 
limited amount (e.g. 10-15) entries are shown to the big audience. Often entries 
get disqualified because they have broken some competition rule or they contain 
material which offended the organizers or they don't work in the organizers' 
computers.</P>
<P>The biggest demo parties are:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="http://www.assembly.org/">Assembly</A> (held in <A 
  href="http://www.finland.fi/">Finland</A> on July-August) 
  <LI><A href="http://www.theparty.dk/">The Party</A> (held in <A 
  href="http://www.denmark.dk/">Denmark</A> few days before New Year) 
  <LI>The Gathering (held in <A href="http://www.norge.no/english/">Norway</A> 
  on Easter) </LI></UL>
<P>They gather several thousand visitors, but there a lots of smaller demo 
parties which gather only few hundred visitors. The average age of people who 
attend demo parties is getting younger and younger each year, now it is about 
15-16 years, but the average age of those people who win competitions is usually 
slightly above 20. The youngest demo scene members are about 10 years of age and 
oldest ones are around 30 years of age. The demo hobby is even more 
male-oriented than other computer use. Almost all demo scene members are men. 
There has been some female musicians and graphicians, but I have never heard of 
a female demo coder. Major demo parties have few percent of female visitors, but 
most these women are girlfriends of male demo scene members or local girls who 
just wandered there, because of free entrance. Women often get free entrance, 
where as boys have to pay 100-250 FIM ($15-$40) to enter a demo party.</P>

<H2><A name=competitions>Competitions</A></H2>
<H3>Demo Competition</H3>
<P>The winners of this competition usually get the best prices (compared to 
other competitions), so in a way this is the "king of competitions". There are 
different categories for different kind of home computers, e.g. separate Amiga 
and PC demo competitions.</P>
<P><IMG height=200 alt=[screenshot] src="index_files/environm.gif" width=320>

Assembly'93 PC demo competition)</EM></P>
<H3>Intro Competition</H3>
<P>The difference between a demo and an intro is the size of the programs. The 
maximum allowed hard disk space for demos is usually 4 megabytes, but for intros 
to limit is usually only 64 kilobytes (40 kilobytes for Amiga intros). 
Assembly'94 was the first big demo party have a 4 kilobyte intro competition. 
Nowadays there are even more extreme intro competitions e.g. 256 byte intro 
competition. The smallest intros are always coded in assembler. It is more 
difficult to get lots of high quality graphics and music and different kind of 
effects to small size. The smallest of intros (&lt;= 4 kilobytes) usually don't 
have any kind of music, because the (stupid) competition rules have disallowed 
them.</P>

competition), Right: A vector world from "Airframe"-intro by Prime (Winner of 
Assembly'94 PC intro competition)</EM></P>
<H3>Graphics Competition</H3>
<P>This is the competition for still images, usually limited to some size (e.g. 
640x480 pixels) and amount of colors (e.g. 256). The subject of picture is free, 
but the most popular ones are fantasy, science fiction, horror and semi-nude or 
nude women. Rules allow only self-drawn images to enter the competition, but 
still often the majority of the winning pictures have cleverly borrowed elements 
from photographs and existing fantasy paintings.</P>
<P>There is often a different category for computer generated 3D graphics, often 
called the ray tracing compo.</P>

<H3>Animation Competition</H3>
<P>Animations are different from demos, because they are rendered in advance, 
where as most of the visuals in demos are calculated in real-time. Animations 
are usually made using some commercial 3D animation package, but some people use 
normal video or hand-drawn animations. The most popular subjects are "rides" 
(flights in space, chases etc.), various fights and humor.</P>
<H3>Music Competition</H3>
<P>Music competition is often divided into different categories e.g. 4-channel 
<A href="http://www.castlex.com/modfaq/">MOD</A>-formats (Protracker), 
multichannel (max. 32-channels) and C64 music competitions. The number of 
channels tells how many instrument sounds can be used simultaneously. There 
length of music file is often limited to about one megabyte and only maximum of 
3-4 minutes of the song are played (but the song can be longer).</P>
<P>The choice for music style is free, but majority of songs are similar to 
techno, euro dance or funk. Music competition usually gathers more entries than 
any other competition. In big demo parties this can mean 200-300 entries. Some 
demo musician are now making music for commercial games or producing commercial 
dance music.</P>

<H3>Wild Competition</H3>
<P>(Almost) anything is accepted in wild competitions, it just has to be "cool". 
The entries are usually supplied on a video tape.</P>
<H3>Fast Competition</H3>
<P>A competition with a strict time limit is called a fast competition. E.g. 
24-hour coding competition or 30-minute graphics competition. The actual 
creation process usually happens on the location.</P>
<H2><A name=design>Different Kind of Demo Designs</A></H2>
<P>The first Amiga, Atari ST and C64 demos were short intros (introductions) 
made by <A href="#cracker">cracker</A> 
groups (people who removed the copy protection) which were presented before the 
game started. The word "<A 
href="#intro">intro</A>" has nowadays a 
different meaning. The early demos and intros usually featured some picture, 
music and a scrolling text. The scrolling text usually contained information 
about the makers of intro and greetings to their friends and people who they 
respect.</P>
<P><IMG height=200 alt=[screenshot] src="index_files/fairlight5.gif" width=320>

<P><EM>Left: A cracking intro by <A 
href="http://www.fairlight.com/">Fairlight</A> (C64), Right: Delusion / Sonic-PC 
(PC)</EM></P>
<P>The intros grew larger and developed more fancier scrolling texts: waving, 
distorting, rotating and/or scaling scrolling texts, many scrolling texts, huge 
scrolling texts, parallax scrolling texts and various kinds of other effects 
such as: 3D graphics (from simple wire frame 3D to filled 3D) bouncing balls 
("bob" or "sprites") plasma (shifting display of colors) <A

etc.</P>

href="http://wwwbrauer.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~brandtf/year89.html">Cuddly</A>"-megademo 
(ST)</EM></P>
<P>Soon the demos were so large that they contained many "screen" with different 
kind of effects and music. People often called them megademos. The word 
"megademo" indicates that the size of demo is about megabyte, but soon it 
started to mean a any multi-part demo.</P>
<P>On Amiga megademos were usually sequential - one screen/effect follows 
another. The user could sometimes skip a part by pressing the left mouse button. 
The rigid non-interactive design allowed the demo makers to synchronise music 
with the screen effects. The best examples of this are the Amiga demos by 
Spaceballs, "State of the Art" and "9 Fingers" which featured motion-captured 
video sequences combined with various graphical effects.</P>
<P>On Atari ST the megademo screens were often made by different demo groups and 
thus having no resemblance between each other. ST megademos usually had a main 
menu screen, where you could select which part of the demo you wanted to watch. 
The main menu was often designed like a computer game e.g. in the Union, 
Mindbomb and <A 
href="http://wwwbrauer.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~brandtf/year90.html">Decade</A> 
megademo the user controlled a character with joystick and selected different 
demo screens by manovering the character over a door. In 1991 megademo "Ooh 
Crikey Wot a Scorcher", the user was controlling a space craft, which was flying 
over a 3D landscape. Many of the ST demos featured <A 
href="http://www.inf.bme.hu/~mandula/secret.txt">hidden screens</A> and reset 
screen (screen started when you pressed the reset button on the machine).</P>
<P><IMG height=200 alt=[screenshot] src="index_files/crikey3.gif" width=320>

(ST), originally the same 3D object was done by <A 
href="http://www.trsi.de/">RSI</A> on Amiga</EM></P>
<P>PC and C64 demos accepted the Amiga-like sequential style of demos with 
little or no interaction. In mid-1990's most Amiga and PC demos were full of 3D 
effects. First there was wireframe 3D, then filled 3D, then flat-shaded 3D, then 
gourad-shaded 3D, texture mapped 3D, bump-mapped 3D, environmental-mapped 3D 
etc. The 3D objects were usually quite simple: a rotating cube, torus, space 
ship and duck are one of the most popular ones. The 3D world of demos is usually 
static/lifeless as opposed to 3D game worlds, which are full of action. Many 
people soon started to consider these "pure" 3D demos boring and new kind of 
demo designs emerged: moving lights and white noise was added to screen. The 
screen was flooded with text messages, but instead of early demos, which had 
long scrolling texts, these were short messages. More and more effects were 
combined together.</P>

<P>So far the demo scene hasn't evolved from concentrating on technical 
excellence instead of content and maybe this is one of reasons why the demo is 
slowly dying away. Most PC demos are still made for DOS and because of this they 
don't take fully advantage of today's hardware (e.g. 3D accelerators), instead 
they still rely on old VGA or SVGA standards via VESA 2.0. If the main point of 
watching demos was to see something "cool" which wasn't possible to do in games, 
the point is now gone, because state-of-the-art games for Windows using cheap 3D 
accelerator cards blow current demos away.</P>
<P>Many old demo scene are nowadays involved in making computer or video games 
(including the <A href="http://mlab.uiah.fi/~eye/">author</A> of this document). 
The production of computer games involves many similar skills which are needed 
to make good demos.</P>
<P>The "golden years" of demo scene (1987-1996) are gone, but I am sure we will 
still see some interesting designs from demo scene.</P>
