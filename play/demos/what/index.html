What is a Demo?</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2>by: aancsiid - Vincent
Scheib</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What:</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Executable <a href="#executable">programs</a>
which produce, in <a href="#realtime">real time</a>, engaging computer
graphics and music. Programming, Art, and music Composition skills are
stressed. Demos are similar in some ways (but are not equivalent) to
music videos or short films.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Where:</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Demos are created at, and submitted to,
competitions called <a href="#demoparties">Demo Parties</a> mostly in western
Europe. Leading countries are Finland, the Netherlands, France, Sweden,
and Germany. There have been a handful of 'Demo Parties' in North America
at Berkeley, UC San Diego, and Canada.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When:</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Demos appeared in the `80s. Intros were
the first form of Demos. They became more popular in the early `90s. People
continuously argue about demos 'fading away' -- however this has yet to
happen.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How:</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Initially, demos were coded exclusively&nbsp;
in <a href="#assembly">assembly</a>, for the Amiga and DOS. Gradually demos
started using <a href="#assembly">C</a>, and finally <a href="#assembly">C++</a>
as well as running in Windows and using hardware accelerated graphics cards.
The music for demos uses special formats similar in concept to <a href="#midi">MIDI</a>
files (but containing their own instrument and vocal audio samples)</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Why:</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Demos are about passion. They are
about getting a computer to do the coolest thing you've ever seen a computer
do. They are about great music, great art, and great programming (All biased
to what the 'scene' has grown to respect).&nbsp;</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">A program is a set of instructions which control
a computer. This text was written on a web page, to view it you use a Browser
such as Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Those are programs, which
allow you to browse the internet. Computer games are programs as well.&nbsp;</font></dd>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">A program is different than just an animation.
An animation is simply a pre-recorded set of images played back for you.
A program must do things (such as evaluate math equations) to be able to
draw computer graphics.</font></dd>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">A program is technically said to be running
in real time if it produces results at a reliable speed. The common use
of the phrase 'real time' implies that the work is being done fast enough
that you need not wait for it. Real time animation means that the animation
is being drawn for you while you watch. A game is real time -- because
you can control it and it responds to you immediately. A movie is not realtime
because the work was done previously, you are just watching it be played
back for you.</font></dd>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">A demo party is usually held for a few days
(3 or so) and usually on a weekend. A large space is found, such as an
auditorium. Most everyone brings their computers and stereos and cool toys.
Loud music is played all the time. People do not sleep (well, some do,
but not many and not often). A large projection screen is found in a room
with a good sound system for viewing of demos. Games are played as well,
but many people also work on demos, intros, music, digital art, videos,
et cetera.&nbsp;</font></dd>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Musical Instrument Digital Interface. Designed
to allow electronic instruments to talk with each other -- and control
one another. MIDI files can contain musical score, and be played back on
computers (as well as electronic pianos or other instruments). MIDI playback
on computers is generally not of very high quality (or hasn't been in the
past) because it was designed to be played back on expensive electronic
instruments. To play back a piano song on a computer the computer must
know how to make piano sounds. Most computers in the 1980s and 1990s did
not contain very realistic piano sounds.&nbsp;</font></dd>
