<h1>The Music of Amnesia</h1>

<p>I'm very proud to feature the first music distribution of the
won't-run-on-Pentiums-anymore classic Amnesia by Renaissance.
Why redistribute the music?  Some background:</p>

<p>In 1992, Tran wrote a new experimental music system called The CDFM
composer.  CDFM files (and their demo-offshoot, 670 files, which had
no song/title/instrument text) contained 4 channels of digital sound,
just like regular mod files, except they also contain 9 FM channels,
just like an Adlib tracker.  This means a standard cheap Sound Blaster
could produce 13 channels of music, and in stereo on a Sound Blaster
Pro--and all on a 386-16 (the machine Tran owned for much of his demoscene
development).  This was nicely demonstrated in Amnesia, as there was
not only great music, but enough CPU time left over for some good effects
as well.  Daredevil remembers where the idea came from:  "Tran thought
of that one on his own, but I'm sure CC probably had some say in it. CC
was never a demanding musician, he could compose with anything."</p>

<p>Renaissance never formally distributed the CDFM composer, claiming it
was too unfinished to release.  Recalls Daredevil, "There were things
in the help screens like 'Don't press ALT-J or you will suffer' and
'ALT-X summons the devil and makes you pay'.  I can't believe Ken put
up with that for as long as he did... heheh ;)"</p>

<p>The innovative Amnesia demo used an early version of Tran's PMODE
extender, and as a result, does not run on most modern machines.  So, when
discussions in the demo newsgroups mentioned Amnesia's technologically
groundbreaking music, and newbies complained they couldn't run Amnesia
to hear it, I thought I'd make the music available (with Tran's and
Daredevil's blessing, of course :-).  Daredevil sums it up:  "CDFM was
the official name... And we even put together an archive file ready to
release, however it never made it out. The tracker looked/felt much
like Composer 669, however it was not for the novice. It had alot of
little quirks/unfinished features that would have made it difficult for
the average user to deal with. The actual file format that the tracker
uses is "C67" and "670" is the format used for demos and such. The
latter of the two does not contain any instrument names or other data
not required for playback in a demo."</p>

<p>The music below is the full music from the demo, as played on a 386sx25
with a Sound Blaster Pro.  There are two formats to choose from:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The MPEG selections are full quality stereo sound.  To hear
	the MPEG selections, you'll need an MPEG level 3 decoder.  If
	you need an MPEG audio player, visit <a
	href="http://www.mpeg.org">www.mpeg.org</a>.</li>

	<li>The RealAudio selections are real-time streaming audio; that
	is, you can listen to the music as it is downloading in
	real time.  (The quality is not as good as the MPEG selections,
	however.)  For the RealAudio 3.0 selections, you'll need the
	RealAudio 3.0 player, available from <a
	href="http://www.realaudio.com">RealAudio's home page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<blink><strong>UPDATE!</strong></blink>  I've inspired DareDevil /
Renaissance to rewrite the CDFM engine!  <a href="dd/">These remastered
clips</a> were played back on a Mediatrix AudioTrix Pro sound card using
a modified version of Tran's original DFM32 music driver mixed in 44.1K
stereo and recorded onto a Digidesign Pro Tools system. The FM portion
of the songs was processed using a Yamaha SPX1000. You can even hear
the flaws in the samples now! :)

<p><em>Coming soon: More CDFM music from RMUZIK0, Ren's Black Glass Demo
2, and some <blink>unreleased</blink> tunes!</em></p>
