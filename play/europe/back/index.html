  <p><font face="Arial">I travelled through Europe this summer with Ryan Geiss, Julie McNeil, and Debbie Wiece. Ryan, Debbie, and I just graduated and took five weeks vacation. (Julie is a slacker -- and has been co-op-ing and will graduate soon.)<BR><BR>

Click on the path we took in Europe and the journal entry for that place will show up. (This was updated as I traveled around, so while I was traveling it was a work in progress.)<br><br>
  Pictures will be up here soon -- hopefully by the winter holidays. (I'm pretty busy.)
