and I are in Eindhoven after taking the night train from Paris. The long
night didn't afford much sleep, but we're feeling fine. I'm writing from
Takeover 2000, which is GREAT! We spent the day in this city because we
arrived very early. There was much to explore. Much more peaceful than
Paris, it is similar to the midwest we are used to. The city however is
more modern, and mixes a hearty&nbsp;<a href="028.html"><img SRC="028.jpg" ALT="Ryan in Eindhoven on odd bowling sculpture" BORDER=2 height=150 width=245 align=RIGHT></a>downtown
with country landscape well. The crosswalk signs tick, so blind can cross
safely, and there are roads specifically for bikes. We explored a great
area of town with shops, which is prepared for the soccer fans. A game
was played here yesterday, and tonight the Netherland's team won again!
But, the true excitement is TakeOver. I'm in a large auditorium that filled
instantly at the start with computers, speakers, and tech gadgets. Demo
music is playing loudly everywhere. People are programming, composing music,
creating art, and playing games everywhere. It's most excellent -- we have
two full days for the competition part!</font></td>

morning. =) The party is STILL going strong, of course. The big competitions
are yet ahead, but this is a good chance to get on the internet. I helped
code parts of a 64kB intro* with a guy, which was rather cool. (He had
all the dirty work done already, I just helped add effects.) It's been
a great party here --- I'm going to sleep like a rock sometime very very
soon. *--An intro is a very small executable program which plays music
and makes cool colorful animations in real time (not prerecorded) on a
computer.</font></td>

some 'bubblegum' J, which was really nice! Brought a group of friends back to 
the hostel and played chess and whatnot. Met Claudia from Chile, who spoke only 
a little English. Speaking with her was interesting. We told her the Big Mouth 
Frog Joke too. Today Ryan and I saw the Anne Frank house. Rather moving. We're 
chilling a bit, the weather is cooler which is nice. Funny thing about Amsterdam 
is that we aren't seeing as many monuments &amp;c, but more just having a good 
time. Netherland vs France tonight too!!! BIG GAME!&nbsp;</font> <p><font 
face="Arial,Helvetica">(Big Mouth Frog Joke: Debbie told this to us somewhere in 
Paris. She messed up and had to restart, which made it all the better. The joke 
is about a frog who always speaks REALLY LOUD WITH A BIG MOUTH, and asks the 
other animals what they do. The owl that he meets says, "I eat big mouth frogs," 
and the frog says 'oh' in a tiny little voice. Humor is in a grand performance 
with someone playing the part of the big mouth frog slowly with a nice gaping 
mouth.)</font>
