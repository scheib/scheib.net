of the Alps are amazing! We could see Mt Blanc as well, 4800 meters high.
We met Arnoud and had a splendid dinner of sausage from Lyon. Sleep this
night was as the dead enjoy, as the sleepiest way to travel does not seem
to be on the sleepy car (an advertisement had claimed this in Amsterdam).&nbsp;</font></td>

We prepared a fine spaghetti &amp; peppers dinner with a bottle of wine,
only $6 for the both of us. On the way to the beach we partook of the French
drink Pastis, which has a strong Anis flavor. The beach at sunset was perfect,
and before we left we made a large Serpinski triangle in the sand.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I went off on my own today and took a train East
along the Mediterranean coast to find Monte Carlo. If you're a computer
graphics buff (I am) than Monte Carlo is a must, as it has the icon of
all randomness and chance, THE Monte Carlo Casino! Quite impressive, the
city is most beautiful. The rocky hills thrust their way up out of the
ocean and sprinkled along them are the wealthy buildings of the city.&nbsp;</font>

Slovenia, France]. It's almost time for our night train out, just a quick

A sleeper car in, and a horrible morning trying to find a place to stay.
The place we did eventually find was one city South! An hour bus ride got
us there, only to find all restaurants closed. Whatever, so I did find
a bottle of wine, which I inhaled half of (quite a nice way to consume
wine), and we just wrote in journals and so forth and got some good rest.</font></td>

took a bit waking up, and decided to get out on a sleeping train. So, let's
see, that left us less than 5 hours to see all of Barcelona! Well, we stepped
up to the challenge and darted right out. We followed the advice of Mark,
from Quebec, which was to see the Sagrada Familia Cathedral. It is a work
in Progress, but already stunning. Most of the steeples are up, and the
plans were finished. It is of a style of architecture known as Modernisme
(which contains many organic elements (the pillars branch as trees, and
the vault ceilings resemble leaves. After, we saw the Parc Guell, which
was wonderfully designed, and offered a grand view of the city and Mediterranean.
There I was toasted by another visitor enjoying wine, as I finished the
second half of my bottle. We raced downtown and saw the Palau de la Musica
Catalana (for the Modernisme again) and the Esglesia Santa Maria del Mar's
Cathedral (which was also very stunning). Whew, all that and a race to
the train station and we were out.</font></td>
