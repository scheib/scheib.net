INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTO GENERATION OF FRAMED IMAGES IN HTML.

1) Generate a batch file with one line for each image in this format:
call build.bat keyword <format number> <jpeg image name> "<description>"

FORMAT NUMBERS:
1  NORMAL, no frames
2  TALL,  column frames
3  WIDE,  row frames

Images are used as JPEG as hard-coded as "filename.jpg" in the template files. 
This can be changed easily by doing a search replace on the template files for 
".jpg" -> ".gif" or whatever.


2) Run batch file in the directory with the build.bat and template .html files. 

3) Perform a search replace on all the generated .html files of the following:
Replace: <space><newline>###<space><newline>    with:<nothing>
In UltraEdit, this would be done with [ ^p### ^P] [] (the []'s not included)

4) Perform a search replace of [<title>"] [<title> and similarly for the closing 
" mark in the title. It is recommended to copy the generated .html files to 
another directory to do this. 

5) Copy the .html files to where they will be used. Also copy the Blank??.html files.
