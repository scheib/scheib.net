<p><font face="Arial">The bottom of the pots show us clearly that
this spherical mapping(left) is wrapping the texture twice, and
shrinkwrap mapping(center) only once. The shrinkwrap mapping
causes some unwanted discontinuity underneath the lip of the pot
however, where we see a the blue and red reversed. This is
because of the 'my normal faces towards the other side so I'll
use that color instead' feature of shrinkwrapping. In this case,
it is undesirable. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It is easy to see the leaves in the
shrinkwrapped object are affected by their normals. (In this case
they are affected in the opposite way as would be desired because
we are looking at the petals as backfaces. The blue ones on the
left would be red if we were not using the reverse normals of the
side we are viewing.) Once again shrinkwrap fails us, but it
worked nicely when viewing from the top.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The triangle face mapping is seen to be
'almost' working on the bottom of the right pot. (The bottom is
made of entirely of three sided polygons, most of which are
texturemapped properly, but cyan shows 'holes' in my algorithm.) </font></p>
