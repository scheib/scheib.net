<p><font face="Arial">A surface is raised or lowered a small
amount according to a texture map. This allows easy generation of
complex bumps, ripples, imperfections, &amp;c. This effect is eye
dependent, rather than just drawing a 'bumpy' texture on a face
it actually affects the lighting calculation to represent the
deformed surface. A great amount of detail can be placed on a
very simple surface for low cost.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Test texture for bump mapping. This is one
from a series of eye positions. The highlighting changes as the
eye position changes, but even in this single picture the box
appears to have a 3D pattern on it. The geometry of the model is
perfectly flat. </font></p>
