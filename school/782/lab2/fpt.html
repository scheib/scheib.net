<p><font face="Arial">Given a position in 2 Dimensions (a face of
an object) return the color of the surface at that point. This
provides 'flat' textures, such as bricks, water, stone, dirt,
bark, gravel, &amp;c.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A brick texture. A pattern 8 layers high
was designed, with variation in brick size and color. The
position is mapped to this table and calculations determine if
the point is on the brick or in the grout. If it is on a brick
the color used is that brick's specific shade of red. Also, the
color varies very slightly across the face of all bricks. This
should be subtle enough for you not to notice, but adds
variation. Noise, or randomness, is also used to provide a
'grainy' appearance to the bricks and grout. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">These two images are produced with the same
texture generator. The algorithm is simple: <em>color_returned =
color_scale * x_position * y_position</em>. Mirroring provides a
rectangular kaleidoscoping action. Each color component, red,
green, and blue, has it's own scaling factor. Limiting the colors
from looping, once overflowing the acceptable color range,
provides interesting effects as seen in both these images. In the
first, the blue and green components to not repeat. In the
second, the red component does not repeat. The second image also
displays a moiré effect on the blue channel. A moiré effect is
a pattern which can be seen due to interference. In this case it
is simple raster sampling aliasing which causes the effect.
Notice that the blue does not follow the same contour lines as
does the red and green. This moiré effect would shimmer
uncontrollably in animation and also be affected by scale
changes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I never did fix my 3 sided polygon filler
(I don't intend to in this codebase), but I thought the bricks
looked particularly interested with this bug.</font></p>
