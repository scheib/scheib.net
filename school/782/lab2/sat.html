<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Summed Area Table Antialiasing:</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A method for antialiasing (smoothing out a
picture, getting rid of jaggies). This algorithm is very simple.
A table is precomputed for a given texture so that at every point
the sum of the color contained to the left and lower of that
point is stored. When rendering a pixel the area of the pixel is
mapped onto this precomputed table. The sum of colors contained
in the screen pixels area can then be obtained. This provides the
average color of that area with very little computation. It is
not a perfect algorithm, but it is better than MIP-mapping.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Cubes of various scales are shown without
and with Summed Area Table antialiasing. The texture used alters
between yellow and purple at increasing frequencies. Notice that
in the first image only pure yellow or pure purple is drawn. In
the second these colors are blurred heavily to converge towards
the average of these two colors. Aliasing can still be seen in
the second image, but it is considerably better than in the first
image. </font></p>
