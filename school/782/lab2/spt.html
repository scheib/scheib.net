<p><font face="Arial">Given a position in 3 Dimensions (a
position in object space) return the color of the surface at that
point. This provides 3D textures, such as wood, fudge marble
cake, regular (stone) marble, &amp;c.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The chess piece on the left uses a regular
'cylindrical' wood grain. The distance from a skewed axis is used
to determine if tan or brown should be drawn. This distance is
perturbed slightly to provide variety. The tan and brown colors
bleed slightly into one another for a smooth transition. On the
right is a failure at a more complicated wood grain. Well, it's
not so much of a failure, as it looks 'ok'. I was attempting to
produce a very compacted gnarled wood grain. The result is just
sort of random brown and tan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">These objects all use the same 'blob'
procedural texture. This works off of a metaball algorithm.
Basically, space is filled with random seed points. When drawing
a point the distance to all seed points is calculated and then
processed through some decreasing function (such as 1/x or
floor(1-x)). All results of this function are summed together
(this is what creates the 'blobby' effect). High and low
threshold parameters are set, and the sum is clamped between
these. Then two colors are interpolated between these values. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The top picture is a very poor marble. It
wasn't really intended to look like marble at all, but it sort of
did. It doesn't make a very good marble because it doesn't use
layering of colors or turbulence. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The bottom picture is my attempt at using
this for a cork or worm eaten wood. I'm not convinced personally,
they just look spotty/blotchy to me. </font></p>
