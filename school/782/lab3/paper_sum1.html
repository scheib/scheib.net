<p>Summarization of:<br>
Cook, Robert L. Thomas Porter, Loren Carpenter. &quot;Distributed
Ray Tracing&quot;. Proceedings of SIGGRAPH'84. In Computer
Graphics 18, 3, pp. 137-145, July 1984.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ray tracing, the process of recursively intersecting a
parameterized line equation with surfaces, is a simple and
elegant rendering algorithm. Shadows, reflection, and refraction
are easily attained, while much more difficult with alternative
display techniques. Extending this algorithm to distributed ray
tracing incorporates: blurred reflections, blurred refraction,
soft shadows, depth of field, and motion blur. This increases the
quality of rendered images dramatically, with relatively little
cost. <br>
<br>
The modification to the traditional ray tracer is very simple.
Sample each pixel multiple times and each time distribute scene
parameters. This point samples many parameters that have a large
range of values. Finally, average the samples together for an
approximation of the contribution of each parameters' diverse
range. Each of the effects are addressed individually below.<br>
<br>
<br>
Blurred Reflections<br>
Reflections in the traditional ray tracer are perfect, or mirror
like. In the distributed algorithm the reflected ray is perturbed
slightly. This creates a glossy reflection, where objects in the
reflection are increasingly blurry the farther away they are.<br>
<br>
Blurred Refraction<br>
In the same way that the reflected ray is perturbed, so is the
refracted ray. This parallels the glossy reflection with glossy
transparency.<br>
<br>
Soft Shadows<br>
Sampling a light source over an area expands upon the simple
'point light' of most ray tracers. When checking for shadows, a
random point is selected from a light source with probability
equal to the proportional amount of light emanating from that
point. This simulates an area light source, which causes soft
shadows.<br>
<br>
Depth of Field<br>
Distributing the eye position over the area of a virtual lens,
while maintaining the center of interest, causes defocusing of
objects not on the focal plane. <br>
<br>
Motion Blur<br>
Randomly positioning objects according to their time
parameterized description of position in space causes motion
blur. These sample points should be taken from the current frame
to be rendered plus or minus some epsilon. <br>
<br>
As stated above, each of these parameters is distributed per
pixel sample. Averaging together multiple samples simultaneously
averages together the point samples of each parameter. Thus all
effects can be obtained for approximately the same cost.</p>
