<font face="Arial,Helvetica">This animation was part of an interactive display I created for the CIS department at OSU. The animation ran full screen on a monitor alone on a table. It was designed to attract people to it and provide useful information about the department via short narrated animations. The display also incorporated creative lighting. By use of another animation and projector, the area was flooded with changing color patterns. I can't recreate the installation here for you, but you can view the animation above (assuming you have shockwave flash installed). By the way, it's 8MB so if you have a slow connection it might take a long while to load.</font>

Text from the movie: Computer Information Science. Welcome to the Computer and  Information Science department  at Ohio State University.  I'm Stu Zweben, the department  chair.  Computer science is one of the  most exciting and dynamic  departments at OSU, featuring  undergraduate programs in the  colleges of Engineering, Arts &  Sciences, and Business.  These diverse programs provide  our nearly 1300 undergrad  C.I.S. students with a rich set of  opportunities in course  selection, undergraduate  research, and organized  activities such as professional  society student chapters.  This allows students to tailor  their programs to meet their  individual interests. Our animated display illustrates  several important and innovative  projects in which our  department is engaged.  Each of these projects is the  result of significant interaction  among our faculty and students,  both graduate and  undergraduate.  Each also integrates aspects of  our research and instructional  programs.  By the way, this animation was  produced by two of C.I.S.'s  undergraduate majors.  I hope you enjoy your short tour  through a part of the C.I.S.  Department.

These lectures are also available on demand.  To see and hear the lectures, only a standard  browser and a 28.8 connection is required. Hi, I'm Vince.  I'm currently a junior in  Computer Science  Engineering. I have  been very pleased with  my undergraduate  experience in the CIS  department. In fact, the  CIS department is why I  choose to come to OSU  in the first place.  Students can study  computers from the  Sciences, and Business  colleges. From each of  those, there are many  ways to customize the  degree. I have chosen a  software specialization,  with an emphasis in  computer graphics. The  CIS department offers  numerous in depth  courses in my interests,  as well as many others.  The CIS department  immediately prepared  me for two professional  internships in computer  graphics. I enjoyed this  work and it has  reinforced my career  choice. My job this  coming summer will be  with a game company.  The CIS department has  offered many classes  that I have made direct  use of, impressing my  employers by spending  very little time orienting  myself. I feel very  prepared to enter the  computer graphics  entertainment industry. also given me a strong  theory background. The  Resolve series, and  numerous other classes,  encourage the  development of abstract  level problem solving  skills.  I have attended  numerous guest  lectures hosted by the  CIS department in  areas of direct interest  to myself. These have  helped me to network  outside of the university  and broaden my  exposure. Many of  these lectures were  supported by the IEEE  and ACM groups.  Speaking of ACM, I  was one of 4 students  sent by our ACM  chapter, last fall, to  Waterloo, Ontario, to  compete in a regional  programming contest.  We performed very  well, and it was a fun  weekend. Numerous committees  help improve the  department. Regularly I  read their minutes,  which are posted to the  newsgroups, and speak  to the undergraduate  representatives to voice  my opinion. These  committees address the  computing  environment,  curriculum, and  accreditation issues.  The professors in the  department have also  offered endless support  for my goals, and I can  not possibly thank them  enough. I am very pleased with  my experience in the  CIS department, and  am seriously  considering continuing  my studies here as a  graduate student.  Thanks for your time, I  hope you enjoy the rest  of this display. =) Queue_ Kernel_1a_C implements Length Accessor extends Dequeue Enqueue Type diversity@cis.ohio-state.edu A $350,000 GE grant supports  undergraduate women and minority  students participating in research projects. seeking out and nurturing high caliber  minority students, we enhance the department's mission of academic excellence. -Dr. Renee Miller #include RESOLVE_Foundation Core Introductory Sequence 221: Software Development  Using Components 222: Development of Software 321: Design and Analysis of Component-Based Systems ?
