                are pictures taken at the end of the third
                quarter. The program culminated in a robot
                competition. All robots were completely
                autonomous (they ran all by themselves, just turn
                them on and let them go). </font><a

                <font face="Arial">Vince Scheib, Matt Kiener,
                Ryan Andrews, and Bruce Isler made up team
                'Sprockets'. We named our robot Deiter. </font></p>

                <font face="Arial">1. Front and back wheels have
                a groove for a rubber band belt giving us 4 wheel
                drive.<br>
                2. Spare rubber band belts are carried already on
                the axles as instant backup. <br>
                3. Disk with holes and an infra red sensor (shaft
                encoder) let's us determine distance traveled.
                The program for the robot based all movements on
                these distance measurements. So when the
                batteries started to wear down, or when our robot
                was turned by another robot, we knew it and could
                correct.<br>
                4. Bump sensors let us know if we're touching a
                wall, or another robot.<br>
                5. Bump sensors down here let us know if we've
                encountered a ramp, or if we're tilted.<br>
                6. This is the Handy Board controller. It ran C
                code and was the 'brain' of the robot.<br>
                7. This Bumper was used to push buttons which
                were receded past a wall (We had to reach over
                the top of the wall to push the button).<br>
                8. This is an infra red beacon. Two of these were
                located in the course and our robot could
                determine it's position by 'looking' for the
                beacons. Our robot could successfully locate it's
                position from any location in the open areas of
                the course. (There is a maze section where the
                walls block line of sight to the beacons, so it
                didn't work there.) <br>
                9. We felt bad being team Sprockets and not using
                any sprockets. So here they are, purley
                decorative sprockets on the front wheels.<br>
                &amp;. There are numerous things not as visible.
                There is a light sensor underneath the robot,
                which let us determine if we were on a white or
                black surface, and also start the race when we
                saw a bright light flash. We used two modified
                servo motors for drive. The frame is made out of
                erector set pieces. Careful planing made our
                frame extremely stable, unlike most other teams
                who had problems with erector set pieces bending,
                flexing, loosening, &amp;c.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Attitude - I programmed 3
                'attitudes' into Dieter. Passive, Aggressive, and
                Annoying. These determined if Dieter would attack
                other robots or not. Annoying would blatantly
                attempt to block the other robot. Aggressive was
                a 'hit and run' strategy intended to disorient
                the other robot and then continue on our way.
                Passive attempted to avoid the other robot and
                run the face faster.</font></p>

                width="590" height="335"><br>
                This is the beginning third of the course. Robots
                started in either white or black boxes. (The
                robot did not know which one it started in, it
                had to figure that out.) They would have to cross
                to the opposite side, push a button which was
                beyond a wall, then move to the maze. The maze
                involved going up a ramp, then zigzagging through
                a simple maze. The final portion of the course
                was another open area. A third robot would run
                about that area and our robots had to 'catch' it
                by pushing buttons located on that robot.</font></p>
