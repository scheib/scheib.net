Scientific Computation, we were assigned an eigeinfaces problem for a homework.
The final goal of this project was to group faces by similarity.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Shown to the right, you see that this was
relatively successful. Notice that people with similar hair are grouped
near each other. On the left, you can see that the two images taken under
different lighting conditions are grouped together, and apart from everyone
else. There are two outliers from most of the class -- distinguished mostly
because of the shoulders, and long dark hair (Hi Kelly).</font></td>

department.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The results were so interesting to me from
the homework assignment, I decided to run the procedure again on a larger
set of faces. The 201 faces were taken from the online photo directory
of the department. It took me about 20 miutes to crop all the images to
just the faces, and numerous hours to run the calculations.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The data isn't as nice as the 16 faces
we collected from the 205 class, however. The lighting conditions are dramatically
different, as are the poses everyone was in.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Still, I was very interested to see what
the result would be from running the simulation on this very large data
set.&nbsp;</font></td>

<tr>
<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Above, you can see 8 of the eigenvectors
from the 201 face dataset. The eigenvectors can be thought of the most
prominent directions in which the images vary. The first eigenvector is
the average of all the faces. For this dataset, the properties captured
by the eigenvectors can be described. The second eigenvector captures the
overall brightness of the face in the picture. The third and forth capture
direction from which the face was illuminated. The fourth captures a bit
of face shape.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The rest of the eigenvectors (there are
201 of them) continue to capture more subtle details. The eigenvectors
are ordered by the amount that the data is distributed by their direction.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The eigenvectors are obtained by a Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD). From these, a set of vectors can be created
which provide a basis for the dataset. Each image is a vector in 15,400
dimensions (140 x 110 pixels). The basis, created by taking the difference
of each eigenvector (2 thru 201) with the first eigenvector, is of only
200 dimensions.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A distance can be calculated between each
of the 201 images in this 200 dimensional basis. Then, a spring mass system
can be constructed, such that a spring between each face has a rest length
equal to the distance between the faces.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The spring mass system can be forced into
only two dimensions, so that we may look at it easily. To do this, each
face is given a random starting position, and then the spring mass system
allowed to bounce around until it comes to a relaxed and stable state.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To the right you can see a plot of the
spring mass system positions as they converge to a stable system.&nbsp;</font></td>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Analysis of the 201 face dataset</font></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The 201 faces did not cluster as nicely as
the 16 faces did.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is clear that the 201 faces arranged
themselves very well with respect to their overall brightness. This is
easy to understand, as the second eigenvector captured this property, and
it's magnitude was 5 times as great as the next eigenvector.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Looking through the faces, you will see
they cluster occasionally by hair mass, lighting, or bright foreheads.
The easiest to see is the hair mass. People was a good area of dark hair
on top group together.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">These lesser properties create only some
small groups however -- and the small groups are held far apart by the
dominating lighting conditions.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It's still pretty nifty to see all 201
images arranged. =) And if you know some of us, well, wave and say "hi".
Can you find me? I'm the only face in profile.</font>
